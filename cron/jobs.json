Summarize what each agent accomplished today: Bighead (data/tech), Dinesh (research/signals), Jared (content strategy), Erlich (BD/partnerships), Gilfoyle (infrastructure/security), Monica (content creation). Identify the top 3 wins of the day (what moved the needle), open items/blockers that need attention tomorrow, and tomorrow's priorities by agent.\n\nPhase 3 — Post EOD summary to #general\nPost to #general: 'EOD Recap — here's what the team accomplished today and what we're focused on tomorrow' followed by:\n- 📊 Today's Wins (top 3)\n- ⚠️ Open Items/Blockers\n- 🎯 Tomorrow's Priorities (by agent)\nKeep it concise but comprehensive; keep your strategic, decisive, team-focused Silicon Valley founder energy and make the team feel momentum.\n\nPhase 4 — Extract and write entities to knowledge/\nAfter posting the summary, extract significant entities from today's activity.\n- SIGNIFICANT = people with deals/partnerships, products being tracked, key competitors, important decisions\n- NOT significant = every HN commenter, random Twitter handle, one-off mentions\n- Quality over quantity: update 2-3 entities well rather than create 10 stubs\n\nFor each significant entity:\n1. Check whether it already exists in $OPENCLAW_HOME/richard/knowledge/\n2. If it exists: append a History entry with today's update and keep the file under 2000 chars\n3. If it is new: create a new entity file in $OPENCLAW_HOME/richard/knowledge/ using this exact format:\n   # Entity Name\n   **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD\n   ## Summary\n   [1-2 sentences]\n   ## Status\n   [active/paused/archived]\n   ## Key Facts\n   - [bullet points]\n   ## Related\n   [[Backlink1]], [[Backlink2]]\n   ## History\n   ### YYYY-MM-DD\n   - [what happened today]\n\nUse [[Obsidian Backlinks]] when referencing related entities. Max 2000 chars per file; prune old History entries if needed. Only write to $OPENCLAW_HOME/richard/knowledge/ (never other agents' knowledge directories).\n\nPhase 5 — Post knowledge update to #ops\nAfter writing entity files, post a brief update to #ops:\n✅ **Richard** — EOD Knowledge Update\n📝 Entities updated: [list entity names]\n🔗 New backlinks: [count]"
