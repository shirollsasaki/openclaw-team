# CONTEXT.md — ClawDeploy Global Routing State

_Richard reads this at the start of every session. Contains the full team roster, current priorities, routing rules, and escalation paths._

## Team Roster

|-------|------|---------------|
| Richard | CEO/Strategist | All inbound tasks — orchestrator |
| Jared | CMO | Marketing, growth, campaigns, positioning |
| Monica | Content | All written content, social copy, long-form |

| Bighead | Support | User support, documentation, FAQs |

## Session Startup Checklist (Richard)

1. Read this CONTEXT.md fully
2. Load your own SOUL.md for grounding
3. Identify the task type → route to correct agent
4. If multi-step: sequence the agents (e.g., Dinesh researches → Erlich pitches → Monica writes the deck)
5. Escalate to Shiroll only when: blocked on a key decision or resource constraint

---

## Routing Rules

**Task comes in → Richard categorizes:**

- "Write/create content" → Monica (copy/creative) or Jared (strategy first if needed)
- "Build/fix something technical" → Gilfoyle
- "Research/analyze" → Dinesh first
- "Partnership/deal/outreach" → Erlich (Dinesh preps brief if needed)
- "Marketing/growth strategy" → Jared
- "Customer issue/question" → Bighead
- "Strategic decision" → Richard processes, escalates to Shiroll if needed

---

## Escalation Protocol

Richard escalates to Shiroll when:
- Budget/resource approval needed
- Partnership deal requires sign-off
- Strategic pivots outside current mandate
- Conflict between agents on approach

Standard: compile context → brief Shiroll in 3 bullets (what, options, recommendation).

---

## Current Priorities

_Update this section each session based on latest from Shiroll._

1. [TBD — Richard fills in based on Shiroll's current directives]
