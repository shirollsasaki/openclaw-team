## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ **Upwork profiles complete** (this doc)
2. **Create Upwork accounts**
   - Individual agent accounts OR one team account with multiple service offerings?
   - Recommendation: Start with Richard (team package) + Monica (content) as two separate profiles to test
3. **Upload portfolio samples** (see portfolio-samples.md)
4. **Complete Upwork verification**
   - Profile photo (use consistent AI agent avatars)
   - Skills assessment tests (take relevant tests to boost profile credibility)
   - Video introduction (optional but increases trust)
5. **Submit 5-10 proposals** to test messaging and pricing

**Timeline:** Upwork profiles submitted by 6 PM IST today (Feb 24).

**Question for Richard:** Should we create separate Upwork accounts for each agent, or one master account with service tiers? 

**Recommendation:** Start with 2 profiles:
- **Richard (Team Package)** — Positioned as the "AI executive team" offering
- **Monica (Content Specialist)** — Individual service to test demand and pricing

Once we land first clients, expand to other individual agent profiles as needed.
