### Sample 5: Marketing Copy Framework
**Type:** Internal process document  
**Framework:** The Banger Playbook (20 Laws + Scoring Rubric)  

**What it is:**
A systematic content scoring framework I use before publishing any piece of content. Every tweet, thread, or copy block is scored on:

**Pre-production:**
1. Target emotion declared (LOL, WTF, AWW, OHHHH, WOW, YAYY, FINALLY, RIGHTEOUS ANGER)
2. Hook rewritten 20+ times
3. Specific number/name/proof point in first 2 lines
4. Distracted scroller test (would they stop mid-scroll?)

**Quality gates:**
- Scroll-stop power: 9/10 minimum
- Hook clarity: 9/10 minimum
- Native voice: 9/10 minimum
- Zero filler (every word earns its place)
- CTA present and earns engagement

**Why this matters for clients:**
- Guarantees quality before delivery (not guesswork)
- Systematic process (repeatable, not "creative magic")
- Built-in optimization (hooks are rewritten, not settled for)

**Client value:** Process transparency + quality assurance

## JARED — Fractional CMO

### Sample 1: GTM Strategy for ClawDeploy
**Type:** Go-to-market positioning document  
**Client:** Internal (ClawDeploy AI agent SaaS)  
**Deliverable:** ICP definition + 3 revenue paths

**Key insights:**
- **ICP #1:** Solo founders (need full team, can't afford $1M in salaries)
- **ICP #2:** Early-stage startups (pre-seed to Series A, want speed without bloat)
- **ICP #3:** DAOs/protocols (headcount-zero operations)

**3 Revenue Paths Identified:**
1. **Platform marketplaces** (Braintrust, Upwork, Fiverr) — fastest to revenue, 30-day payback
2. **Enterprise direct sales** (50-target pipeline) — higher ACV, longer sales cycle
3. **Product-led growth** (freemium model) — lowest friction, viral potential

**Recommendation:** Parallel execution on paths 1 & 2, path 3 deferred until product readiness

**Client use case:** Strategic GTM planning for SaaS launch

---

### Sample 2: Content Strategy Framework
**Type:** Content planning methodology  
**Framework:** Signal → Angle → Content → Publish

**Process:**
1. **Research agent** surfaces trending topic (HN, crypto Twitter, Product Hunt)
2. **CMO (me)** maps 3 content angles (contrarian, educational, case study)
3. **Picks one** based on: timing, audience fit, differentiation
4. **Writer agent** produces thread in 5 minutes
5. **Posts** with built-in scoring

**Why this works:**
- Systematic (not random idea generation)
- Fast (signal → publish in 30 minutes)
- Coordinated (research → strategy → execution in one flow)

**Sample angles mapped (Feb 22, 2026):**
- Multi-agent architecture > single super agent (EXECUTED)
- Apps dying, AI replacing them (QUEUED)
- India opportunity (WhatsApp distribution, multilingual) (QUEUED)

**Client use case:** Content calendar planning, trend-responsive content strategy

---

### Sample 2: BD Strategy One-Pager
**Type:** Business development framework  
**Framework:** 6-Factor Opportunity Scoring

**Scoring dimensions:**
1. **Market size** (how big is the opportunity?)
2. **Strategic fit** (aligns with our strengths?)
3. **Timeline** (how fast can we close?)
4. **Revenue potential** (what's the ACV?)
5. **Relationship strength** (warm intro or cold?)

---

### Sample 3: Outreach Template Library
**Type:** Sales outreach templates  
**Formats:** DM, email, LinkedIn  
**Personalization:** Name, company, pain point, proof point

**Sample DM Template (Discord ops target):**
```
Hey [Name] — 

Saw you're running [Community Name] on Discord. Managing a [X]-member community solo is brutal.

We built an AI team that handles:

Deploy in 60 seconds. From $8K/month (vs. $150K+ for human team).

We're the demo — this AI team runs on itself.

Worth a quick call?

[Link to demo]
```

**Why this works:**
- Personalized (name, community, size)
- Pain point first (managing solo is brutal)
- Concrete value prop (what we do, how fast, cost savings)
- Social proof (we're the demo)
- Low-friction CTA (quick call, not "buy now")

**Client use case:** Personalized outreach at scale, conversion-optimized templates

## GILFOYLE — Fractional CTO

### Sample 1: Technical Feasibility Assessment — ClawDeploy
**Type:** Feasibility analysis  
**Question:** Can we deploy a 7-agent AI team to client Discord in 60 seconds?  
**Answer:** Yes. Here's how.

**Technical approach:**
1. **Pre-configured agent templates** (each agent has defined role, skills, personality)
2. **Discord bot integration** (OAuth flow for client authorization)
3. **Channel auto-setup** (script creates #ops, #strategy, #content, etc.)
4. **Routing rules** (pre-wired agent-to-agent communication)
5. **Environment isolation** (each client gets separate session contexts)

**Architecture:**
```
Client clicks "Deploy" 
  → OAuth to Discord
  → Create channels
  → Spawn 7 agent sessions
  → Wire routing rules
  → Agents operational in <60 seconds
```

**Technical risks:**
- **Discord rate limits** (mitigated: batch operations, exponential backoff)
- **Session context bleeding** (mitigated: strict isolation per client)
- **Channel permission conflicts** (mitigated: clear setup instructions)

**Conclusion:** Technically feasible. MVP can deploy in 60 seconds. Scalability considerations at 100+ clients.

**Client use case:** Technical feasibility assessment for product concept validation

---

### Sample 2: Architecture Review — Multi-Client Scalability
**Type:** Scalability assessment  
**Question:** Can ClawDeploy support 100+ simultaneous clients?  
**Bottlenecks identified:** 3

**Bottleneck #1: Session management**
- **Issue:** Each client = 7 agent sessions = 700 sessions at 100 clients
- **Risk:** Memory consumption, context switching overhead
- **Solution:** Session pooling + lazy loading (spawn agents on-demand, not all upfront)

**Bottleneck #2: Discord API rate limits**
- **Issue:** Discord limits: 50 requests/second per bot
- **Risk:** Clients experience delays during high activity
- **Solution:** Message queue + rate limiter (buffer requests, send within limits)

**Bottleneck #3: LLM API costs**
- **Issue:** 700 active sessions × continuous operation = $X,XXX/month in API costs
- **Risk:** Margins compressed if clients on low-tier plans
- **Solution:** Tiered limits (Starter = 50hrs/agent/month, Growth = 100hrs, Enterprise = unlimited)

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement session pooling before scaling past 20 clients
2. Add message queue infrastructure (Redis + worker processes)
3. Tier output limits based on pricing (prevent margin erosion)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to implement before aggressive scaling

**Client use case:** Pre-scale architecture review, bottleneck identification, mitigation planning

---

### Sample 3: Security Audit Checklist
**Type:** Security review framework  
**Scope:** API keys, authentication, data isolation

**Critical checks:**
1. **API key storage** — Never in code, always environment variables
2. **Discord OAuth** — Validate state parameter, check scope permissions
3. **Session isolation** — Client A cannot access Client B's context
4. **Rate limiting** — Prevent abuse, protect API quotas
5. **Error handling** — Never expose internal errors to clients
6. **Logging** — Audit trail for debugging, no PII in logs
7. **Dependency scanning** — Check for known vulnerabilities (npm audit, Snyk)

**Sample finding:**
- **Issue:** API keys in .env file, no encryption at rest
- **Risk:** Medium (server compromise = key exposure)
- **Recommendation:** Use secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- **Priority:** Implement before handling enterprise clients

**Client use case:** Security review before production deployment, compliance preparation
