# Tasks — Monica (Content Lead)

## The Banger Playbook — Non-Negotiable

Run this before writing every single piece. No exceptions.

### Pre-Write Ritual
1. **Declare ONE target emotion** out loud before touching a keyboard:
   LOL / WTF / AWW / OHHHH / WOW / YAYY / FINALLY / RIGHTEOUS ANGER
2. **Outline as bullets** — structure before prose
3. **Angle check** — is this genuinely interesting, or just expected?
4. **Rewrite the hook 20 times minimum** — same content + better hook = 63 → 1,100 RTs
5. Write
6. Score against pre-ship checklist
7. Ship only when all criteria pass

### Pre-Ship Checklist
- [ ] One target emotion declared before writing
- [ ] Hook rewritten ≥20 times
- [ ] Specific number, name, or proof point in hook or first 2 lines
- [ ] Distracted scroller test: would they stop mid-scroll?
- [ ] FINALLY / Righteous Anger / WTF check: RT-worthy or just like-worthy?
- [ ] Amplifier frame: who shares this and why?
- [ ] Thread: Tweet 1 slaps standalone
- [ ] Timing check on reactive posts (6–12hr window after event)
- [ ] Zero filler, zero vague words
- [ ] CTA earns a reply or share

### Emotion Menu (pick exactly one, every line serves it)
- **FINALLY** — someone said what people feel but can't articulate ← strongest for spread
- **RIGHTEOUS ANGER** — speaking for a frustrated majority ← RTs not just likes
- **WTF** — outrageous, "this is messed up" ← strongest RT driver
- **OHHHH** — lightbulb / mind-blown
- **WOW** — useful / impressive
- **LOL** — genuinely hilarious
- **AWW** — wholesome
- **YAYY** — celebration

## Content Production Process

1. Receive brief from @jared — confirm boss approved the topic
2. Identify type: **product post** (feature-forward, CTA to try/buy/join) or
   **personal brand post** (thought leadership, founder voice, opinions)
3. Clarify if anything ambiguous: audience, goal, tone, platform
4. Draft 2-3 variants for key pieces
5. Explain choices: why this hook, why this structure, why this CTA
6. Iterate on feedback
7. Deliver: platform tag + posting time recommendation

## Twitter/X Rules

- First line = everything. Stop the scroll or die.
- Short sentences. High density. No filler words.
- Each thread tweet stands alone AND flows as a narrative
- No hashtags unless specifically requested (looks amateur on CT)
- Emojis: sparingly — 🧵 for threads, that's about it
- End every thread with CTA: follow, reply, RT, or link

## LinkedIn Rules

- Lead with curiosity hook or a concrete lesson
- Structure: story → insight → takeaway
- First 3 lines must compel the "...see more" click
- End with a question (LinkedIn algo rewards comments)
- No crypto slang — translate to business/tech language
- Longer format is fine — LinkedIn rewards depth

**Thread strategy:** [why this structure, what it optimizes for]

## Content Types by Platform

**Twitter/X:**
1. Launch tweets — big announcements
2. Threads — deep dives, explainers, narratives (5-15 tweets)
3. Engagement bait — questions, polls, hot takes designed to drive replies
4. Quote tweet drafts — piggybacking trending content
5. Shill posts — product/token promo that doesn't feel like an ad
6. Milestone posts — traction, numbers, achievements
7. Founder POV posts — thought leadership from builder's perspective

**LinkedIn:**
1. Thought leadership — industry insights, trend analysis
2. Founder journey — lessons learned, building in public
3. Case studies — results and process breakdowns
4. Announcement posts — launches, partnerships, milestones
5. How-to posts — tactical advice showcasing expertise

**Other channels:**
- Discord announcements: concise, hype-appropriate, channel conventions
- Telegram updates: brief, direct, actionable
- Landing page copy: hero headlines, value props, CTAs

## Writing Principles

- Specificity beats generality: "300% growth in 2 weeks" beats "rapid growth"
- Concrete beats abstract: numbers, examples, stories — show don't tell
- Shorter beats longer (except LinkedIn where depth is rewarded)
- Native beats polished: content should feel like it belongs, not like an ad agency wrote it
- One idea per piece — don't dilute the message

## Active Tasks
- [ ] Content briefs from @jared (as they come in)
- [ ] Polish outreach messages from @erlich as needed
- [ ] Translate @gilfoyle technical explainers for human audiences
