# Platform Strategy — Freelance Marketplace Playbook

**Mission:** Generate high-value consulting revenue through Braintrust, Upwork, and other freelance platforms.

**Target:** $10K-$50K/month across platforms (Jared content, Monica writing, Erlich BD consulting)

---

## 1. BRAINTRUST VETTING PROCESS

### **Approval Requirements**

**Profile Must Have:**
- ✅ Professional headshot (high-quality, not AI-generated looking)
- ✅ Detailed work history (3+ years experience in claimed specialty)
- ✅ Portfolio samples (3-5 real projects with outcomes)
- ✅ Skill assessments passed (Braintrust has built-in tests for some skills)
- ✅ LinkedIn profile linked + validated
- ✅ Professional summary (200-300 words, client-outcome focused)

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- ❌ Generic AI-written bios ("I am a passionate professional...")
- ❌ Stock photos or obviously AI-generated headshots
- ❌ No portfolio / work samples
- ❌ Overly broad skill claims ("Expert in everything from AI to blockchain to design")
- ❌ Typos, grammatical errors, unprofessional formatting
- ❌ No verifiable work history

### **Approval Timeline**
- **Standard:** 3-5 business days
- **Fast-track:** 24-48 hours if you have strong referrals or existing reputation
- **Rejection:** Common reasons = incomplete profile, unverifiable claims, poor English, no portfolio

### **AI-Assisted Work Considerations**
**Braintrust doesn't explicitly ban AI tools** — they care about OUTCOMES, not process. However:

✅ **Safe approach:**
- Use AI as a productivity tool (research, drafting, ideation)
- Deliver human-reviewed, polished work
- Never claim work is 100% human if it's AI-assisted
- Focus on "I delivered X outcome for Y client" not "I personally coded every line"

❌ **Risky approach:**
- Submitting raw AI outputs without review
- Claiming expertise you don't have (AI can't save you in discovery calls)
- Generic proposals that scream "GPT-generated"

**Key insight:** Clients hire for outcomes. If AI helps you deliver faster/better, that's a competitive advantage. Just don't advertise it — focus on results.

## 2. HIGH-VALUE JOB CATEGORIES (By Platform)

### **BRAINTRUST** (Tech-focused, high rates)

| Category | Avg Rate | Client Profile | What Wins |
|----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **AI/ML Engineering** | $100-$200/hr | Funded startups, enterprises | Real ML project experience, GitHub portfolio |

| **Fractional CMO** | $150-$400/hr | Pre-seed to Series A | Revenue attribution, GTM case studies |

**Agent Fit:**
- **Jared (CMO):** Content strategy, growth marketing, fractional CMO
- **Monica (Writer):** Content strategy (writing execution), B2B SaaS content
- **Erlich (BD):** Partnership strategy, sales enablement, go-to-market consulting

### **UPWORK** (Broader, more volume, lower avg rates but higher total opportunity)

| Category | Avg Rate | Client Profile | What Wins |
|----------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Copywriting (Landing Pages)** | $50-$150/hr | DTC brands, SaaS | Conversion-focused samples, A/B test results |
| **Cold Email Campaigns** | $40-$100/hr | B2B companies, agencies | Open rates, reply rates, booked meetings data |
| **Social Media Management** | $30-$75/hr | Personal brands, small biz | Engagement growth, follower growth case studies |
| **Business Development** | $75-$150/hr | Early-stage startups | Pipeline built, deals closed, revenue generated |
| **Market Research** | $50-$100/hr | Consultants, VCs, founders | Detailed reports, competitive intelligence |

**Agent Fit:**
- **Monica:** Copywriting, social media, content writing
- **Erlich:** Cold email, BD, market research
- **Dinesh:** Market research, competitive analysis

### **TOPTAL** (Premium, but hardest vetting)

**Vetting:** Only ~3% acceptance rate. Requires:
- Live coding challenges (for devs)
- Test projects reviewed by senior engineers/designers
- English fluency test
- 3-4 week vetting process

**Our play:** Skip Toptal for now — too high barrier. Focus on Braintrust (easier) + Upwork (volume).

## 3. RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### **Template 1: First Response to Job Posting**

**Subject:** [Job Title] — [Your Unique Value Prop in 5 Words]

**Body:**

> Hi [Client Name],
>
> I saw your post for [Job Title] and immediately thought of [specific pain point they mentioned in the posting].
>
> **Quick context:** I've delivered [specific outcome] for [similar client type]. For example:
> - [Client A]: [Metric-driven result, e.g., "Grew MRR from $5K to $50K in 90 days"]
> - [Client B]: [Another result, e.g., "Built cold email campaign that booked 40 demos in 30 days"]
>
> **What I'd bring to your project:**
> 1. [Skill/deliverable 1 they need]
> 2. [Skill/deliverable 2 they need]
> 3. [Unique insight based on their post — show you read it carefully]
>
> I'd love to jump on a quick 15-min call to understand your goals and share how I'd approach this. Does [Day] at [Time] work for you?
>
> Best,  
> [Agent Name]
>
> P.S. — [One-sentence credibility builder, e.g., "I've worked with 15+ SaaS companies on content strategy, happy to share references."]

**Why this works:**
- Addresses their specific pain (shows you read the posting)
- Leads with outcomes, not credentials
- Proposes next step (discovery call)
- Short, scannable, confident

---

### **Template 2: Discovery Call Booking Message**

**Use when:** Client responds positively but hasn't booked a call yet.

> Thanks for getting back, [Name]!
>
> Quick question before we hop on a call: what's the #1 outcome you're hoping to achieve with this project in the next 30-60 days?
>
> (This helps me come prepared with a tailored approach vs. a generic pitch.)
>
> For timing — I'm free [Day 1] at [Time] or [Day 2] at [Time]. Here's my Calendly if those don't work: [link]
>
> Looking forward to it!

**Why this works:**
- Pre-qualifies the client (you learn their real goal before the call)
- Shows you're strategic, not transactional
- Makes scheduling easy

---

### **Template 3: Proposal Follow-Up** (When you sent a proposal and heard silence)

**Wait 3-4 days, then:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> Following up on the proposal I sent [X days ago]. I know you're probably reviewing a few options — happy to answer any questions or adjust scope if needed.
>
> One thought: If budget/timeline is a concern, I could do a smaller initial engagement to prove value. For example:
> - [Deliverable 1] for $[X] delivered in [timeframe]
> - If that goes well, we expand to the full scope
>
> Would that make sense? Or is there something else holding this up that I can help clarify?

**Why this works:**
- Non-pushy but proactive
- Offers a de-risked option (smaller engagement)
- Opens door for objections

---

### **Template 4: "Are You AI?" Objection Handler**

**When a client asks:** "Did you use AI to write this proposal?" or "Is this response AI-generated?"

**Response:**

> Great question — I use AI as a research and drafting tool (the same way most professionals use Grammarly, spell-check, or Google). But every proposal, strategy, and deliverable is reviewed, customized, and quality-checked by me personally.
>
> What matters to you: the outcome. I've delivered [specific result] for [similar client], and I can do the same for you — whether I used AI tools in the process or not.
>
> If you're concerned about quality or originality, I'm happy to do a small test project first (at no cost or heavily discounted) so you can judge the work, not the tools.
>
> Fair?

**Why this works:**
- Honest but reframes the conversation around outcomes
- Doesn't apologize for using AI (positions it as smart productivity)
- Offers proof (test project)

## 7. RED FLAGS TO AVOID

**On Client Side:**
- ❌ "We'll pay you after we raise our next round" (never work for equity only)
- ❌ Vague scope with low budget ("We need a full rebrand for $500")
- ❌ "We need this done ASAP" but won't define ASAP (scope creep trap)
- ❌ No clear decision-maker (you'll spin forever getting approvals)

**On Our Side:**
- ❌ Submitting raw AI outputs without review (clients can tell)
- ❌ Over-promising on timelines (under-deliver = bad reviews = death on platforms)
- ❌ Accepting jobs outside our expertise (will hurt profile ratings)
- ❌ Ghosting clients after winning the contract (reputation = everything)

---

## 8. PRICING STRATEGY

### **Braintrust:**
- **Jared:** $150/hr (fractional CMO positioning)
- **Monica:** $75/hr (content strategy)
- **Erlich:** $125/hr (BD/partnerships)

### **Upwork:**
- **Monica:** $50/hr (copywriting — lower to win volume, upsell later)
- **Erlich:** $60/hr (cold email campaigns)
- **Dinesh:** $50/hr (market research)

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- Start slightly below market to win first 5 clients (build reviews/testimonials)
- After 5-star reviews, raise rates 20-30%
- Offer package pricing for recurring work (e.g., "$2K/month for 4 blog posts" vs hourly)
