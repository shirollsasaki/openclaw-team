# BD Playbook — Erlich's Business Development Frameworks

## When to Use This Skill
Use these frameworks when running outreach campaigns, evaluating partnership opportunities, structuring deals, or managing the BD pipeline. This is how you turn relationships into revenue.

---

## Framework 1: MEDDIC Qualification

Before investing serious time in any deal or partnership, qualify it. MEDDIC is your filter.

| Letter | Stands For | The Question to Answer |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **M** | Metrics | What's the measurable impact for them? (revenue, users, cost savings) |
| **E** | Economic Buyer | Who actually controls the budget and can say yes? |
| **D** | Decision Criteria | What does their ideal solution look like? What are their must-haves? |
| **D** | Decision Process | How do they make decisions? Who else is involved? What's the timeline? |
| **I** | Identify Pain | What's the specific problem they're trying to solve RIGHT NOW? |
| **C** | Champion | Is there someone inside who wants this to happen and will fight for it? |

### MEDDIC Scoring
Score each letter 0-2:
- 0 = Unknown / not addressed
- 1 = Partially understood
- 2 = Fully qualified

**Total 10-12:** High-priority deal. Move fast.
**Total 6-9:** Promising. Fill the gaps before investing more time.
**Total 0-5:** Not ready. Either nurture or deprioritize.

### MEDDIC for Crypto/Creator Partnerships
- **Economic Buyer** in crypto is often the DAO multisig or a protocol's core team — identify who controls the treasury
- **Champion** in creator partnerships is the creator themselves or their manager
- **Pain** for brands wanting creator distribution: "We have budget but no authentic reach in this community"
- **Pain** for protocols wanting listing/curation: "We're not getting discovered by the right users"

## Framework 2: Hyper-Personalized Outreach System

Generic outreach is spam. Every message must prove you did your homework.

### The 5-Step Outreach Process

**Step 1: Deep Research (10-15 min per target)**

What to look for:
- Last 10 tweets/posts — what are they excited about? frustrated by? building?
- Recent company news (funding, product launches, team changes)
- Their stated goals or problems (look for "we're trying to..." or "struggling with...")
- Mutual connections or shared context
- Their communication style (formal? casual? technical? meme-heavy?)

**Step 2: Hook Construction**

The hook is the first sentence. It must prove you're not a bot.

Formula: `[Specific observation about them] + [Why it's relevant to what you're about to say]`

Examples:
- ❌ Bad: "I saw you're building in the Base ecosystem and thought you'd be interested in Corners.market"
- ✅ Good: "Your thread last week about curation being the missing layer in crypto — that's literally what we're building at Corners.market"
- ✅ Good: "Noticed you just shipped [specific feature] — the distribution problem you mentioned in your launch post is exactly what our creator network solves"

**Step 3: Value Proposition Framing**

Lead with THEIR gain, not your pitch. The structure:
1. Acknowledge their world (what they're trying to do)
2. Identify the specific gap or friction
3. Show how you solve it (one sentence, no jargon)
4. Proof point (one number, one name, one result)

**Step 4: CTA Calibration**

Match the ask to the relationship stage:

| Stage | Appropriate CTA |
|-------|----------------|
| Cold (never spoken) | "Worth a 15-min call?" or "Curious what you think about this" |
| Warm (mutual connection or prior engagement) | "Want to explore what a partnership could look like?" |
| Hot (they've expressed interest) | "Can we get on a call this week to work out the details?" |

**Never** ask for a big commitment in a cold message. Never.

**Step 5: Follow-Up Cadence**

```
Day 0: Initial message
Day 3: Follow-up #1 — add new value (a relevant article, a data point, a question)
Day 7: Follow-up #2 — different angle or different channel
Day 14: Break-up message — "I'll stop following up after this. If timing changes, I'm here."
```

After the break-up message: stop. Move on. Add to a "re-engage in 90 days" list.

## Framework 3: Partnership Evaluation Scorecard

Not every partnership is worth pursuing. Score before committing.

| Dimension | Weight | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Revenue Potential** | 30% | | Direct revenue or clear path to revenue? |
| **Strategic Fit** | 25% | | Does this advance our core mission? |
| **Effort Required** | 20% | | How much time/resources to close and execute? (5=low effort) |
| **Exclusivity Risk** | 15% | | Does this lock us out of better deals? (5=no risk) |
| **Timeline to Revenue** | 10% | | How fast does money flow? (5=immediate) |

**Weighted Score:**
- 4.0-5.0: Priority. Pursue aggressively.
- 3.0-3.9: Pursue if bandwidth allows.
- 2.0-2.9: Deprioritize. Only if they come to us.
- Below 2.0: Pass.

### Partnership Types We Pursue

**Distribution Partnerships** — They have our audience, we have a product they'd love
- Target: Crypto newsletters, Twitter accounts with 10K+ engaged followers in our niche
- Value exchange: Revenue share on referred users, or co-created content

**Integration Partnerships** — Our product + their product = better together
- Target: Wallets, portfolio trackers, on-chain analytics tools
- Value exchange: API access, co-marketing, featured placement

**Creator Network Deals** — Monetizing our 55-person creator network
- Target: Brands wanting authentic crypto/tech creator reach
- Value exchange: Sponsored content, product reviews, community campaigns

**Protocol/Chain Partnerships** — Base ecosystem, other L2s wanting distribution
- Target: Protocols that want their projects curated/featured on Corners.market
- Value exchange: Featured placement, community access, co-marketing budget

## Framework 4: Creator Network Monetization Playbook

We have 55 creators. This is our biggest unfair advantage. Here's how to monetize it.

### Revenue Stream 1: Sponsored Content Deals

**Pricing Framework:**
- Base rate: $[CPM] × estimated impressions per creator
- Typical range: $500-$5,000 per creator per campaign depending on audience size
- Network deal (10+ creators): 20% discount on per-creator rate, but minimum commitment

**How to Pitch Brands:**
1. Lead with the network's aggregate reach and engagement (not just follower count)
2. Show niche relevance — "55 creators who are trusted voices in crypto/dev tools"
3. Offer a pilot (3 creators, one campaign) before asking for a full network deal
4. Provide a media kit: audience demographics, engagement rates, past campaign results

**What Brands Pay For:**
- Authentic endorsement (not "ad" vibes)
- Niche audience access (crypto degens, developers, early adopters)
- Content that lives on (evergreen posts, not just stories)

### Revenue Stream 2: Affiliate/Referral Programs

**Structure:**
- CPA (cost per acquisition): $X per signup/purchase referred
- Revenue share: Y% of revenue from referred customers for Z months
- Hybrid: Small CPA + smaller ongoing rev share

**For Corners.market:** Creators earn a % of transaction fees from users they refer
**For Early.build:** Creators earn a flat fee per developer signup + % of first purchase

**Tracking:** Use a unique referral link per creator. Track in a simple spreadsheet until volume justifies a proper affiliate platform.

### Revenue Stream 3: Co-Created Products

When to do it: Creator has an audience that perfectly matches our product, AND they have credibility in that space.

**Structure options:**
- Creator as advisor: 1-2% equity or token allocation, their name on the product
- Creator as co-founder: 10-20% rev share, significant input on product direction
- Creator as distributor: Pure rev share, no product input

**Red flags:** Creator wants equity but won't commit time. Creator has audience but no credibility. Creator wants to control product direction without technical understanding.

### Revenue Stream 4: Network-as-Distribution for Launches

When we launch a new product or feature, the 55-person network is our launch engine.

**Launch Activation Protocol:**
1. Brief creators 1 week before launch (what it is, why their audience cares, key talking points)
2. Provide assets: copy templates, images, demo video
3. Coordinate timing: stagger posts over 48h for sustained momentum, not one-day spike
4. Incentivize: early access, revenue share on referred users, or flat fee for launch posts
5. Track: monitor engagement, signups from creator links, amplify the best-performing posts

## Framework 6: Objection Handling Library

### "We're not looking for partnerships right now"
**Translation:** You haven't made the value clear enough, or timing is genuinely bad.
**Response:** "Totally understand. When would be a better time to revisit? And just so I can make it relevant when we do — what would need to be true for a partnership to make sense for you?"

### "We already have something similar"
**Translation:** They think you're a commodity.
**Response:** "Makes sense — what are you using? I ask because [specific differentiator] is something most solutions don't handle well, and it might be worth a quick comparison."

### "What's your user count?"
**Translation:** They want social proof. They're worried about betting on a small player.
**Response:** Lead with engagement quality over quantity. "We're early, but our users are [specific quality — e.g., 'active Base ecosystem builders who transact daily']. For what you're trying to accomplish, [X engaged users] is more valuable than [Y passive ones]."

### "Send me a deck"
**Translation:** Polite brush-off, OR they're genuinely interested but not ready to talk.
**Response:** "Happy to — what's the most important thing you'd want to see in it? I want to make sure it's actually useful for your situation, not a generic pitch."

### "Let's revisit in Q3"
**Translation:** Not a priority now. May or may not be in Q3.
**Response:** "Sounds good. I'll put a reminder for [specific date in Q3]. Is there anything that would make this more urgent before then, or is it purely a timing thing?"

### "Your product isn't ready yet"
**Translation:** They see potential but want to wait for maturity.
**Response:** "Fair. What specifically would need to be true for you to feel confident? I want to make sure we're building toward the right milestones."

### "We don't do rev share deals"
**Translation:** They prefer flat fees or equity.
**Response:** "No problem — what deal structure works best for you? We're flexible on the mechanics as long as the value exchange makes sense for both sides."

### "I need to talk to my team"
**Translation:** You haven't found the economic buyer yet, OR they're genuinely interested and need internal alignment.
**Response:** "Of course. Would it be helpful if I joined that conversation to answer technical questions? Or would you prefer I put together a one-pager that makes it easy for you to present internally?"

## Framework 7: Pipeline Management System

### Stage Definitions

| Stage | Definition | What Moves It Forward |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Identified** | Found a potential target, haven't reached out | Research complete, message drafted |
| **Contacted** | Outreach sent, awaiting response | They respond (any response) |
| **Qualified** | Had initial conversation, MEDDIC score ≥ 6 | Agree to explore further |
| **Pitched** | Presented our proposal | They give feedback or ask questions |
| **Negotiating** | Actively discussing terms | Both sides making concessions |
| **Closed Won** | Deal signed, live | Revenue flowing |
| **Closed Lost** | Dead deal | Document why, set re-engage date |
| **Nurturing** | Not ready now, but worth keeping warm | Check in every 30-60 days |

### Weekly Pipeline Review Format
Every Monday, review each active deal:
1. What's the current stage?
2. What's the next action and who owns it?
3. Is there a blocker? What's needed to unblock?
4. Is this deal stalling? (No movement in 2+ weeks = needs intervention or deprioritization)

### When to Kill a Deal
- MEDDIC score hasn't improved after 3 touchpoints
- Economic buyer is unreachable
- They've asked for the same information 3 times without moving forward
- The deal economics no longer make sense (they've changed their requirements)
- You've been "nurturing" for 6+ months with no progress

## Framework 8: Crypto/Web3 BD Specifics

### Approaching DAOs and Protocols

DAOs are not companies. The decision-making process is different:
- Find the **core contributors** (not just token holders) — they're the ones who actually ship
- Look for the **grants committee** or **ecosystem fund** — this is where partnership budget lives
- Engage in their **Discord/governance forum** before cold outreach — warm yourself up
- Frame partnerships as **ecosystem growth**, not vendor relationships

**Typical DAO Partnership Structure:**
- Grant from their ecosystem fund (one-time payment for integration/listing)
- Co-marketing agreement (mutual promotion)
- Revenue share on protocol fees generated through our platform

### Token-Based Partnership Structures

Options when cash isn't the right medium:
- **Token allocation:** They give us X tokens from their treasury; we provide Y service
- **Vesting schedule:** Tokens vest over 12-24 months to align incentives
- **Performance-based:** Token allocation tied to specific metrics (users referred, TVL generated)

**Caution:** Token deals look great on paper when the token is up. Model the deal assuming the token drops 80%. Does it still make sense?

### Community-First Approach

In crypto, community trust is the currency. BD tactics that work in SaaS can backfire here:
- **Don't:** Cold pitch in Discord DMs (seen as spam, can get you banned)
- **Do:** Contribute value in public channels first, then reach out
- **Don't:** Lead with "we have X users" (crypto people are skeptical of vanity metrics)
- **Do:** Lead with on-chain proof (transactions, TVL, active wallets)

### The "We're Decentralized" Objection

When a protocol says "we don't have a BD team, everything goes through governance":
1. Ask who the core contributors are (there's always someone who drives decisions)
2. Submit a governance proposal — but get a champion to co-author it
3. Frame it as a community benefit, not a business deal
4. Be patient — governance moves slowly. Build the relationship while the proposal is live.
