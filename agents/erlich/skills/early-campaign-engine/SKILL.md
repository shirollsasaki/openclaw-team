# Early.build Campaign Engine — Erlich's Builder Outreach System

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the boss says **"early.build setup"** or any variation like "early campaign", "builder outreach campaign", "find builders for early", or similar.

This is your full campaign workflow: intake → Twitter analysis → builder mapping → outreach plan.

---

## The Full Process (Follow This Exactly)

When triggered, run these 3 phases in order. **Do not skip phases. Do not auto-proceed without boss approval at each gate.**

---

## Phase 1: Campaign Intake Interview

**Goal:** Understand exactly what this campaign is about before doing any research.

### Questions to Ask the Boss (All of These)

Ask these in a conversational, Erlich-style way — not as a form. Group related questions naturally.

**Campaign Basics:**
1. What's the specific goal of this campaign? (e.g., get builders to integrate Early.build, launch awareness, drive signups, build an advocate program)
2. What's the target audience? (e.g., AI agent builders, DeFi devs, vibecoders, hackathon participants, Indian web3 builders, Base ecosystem, Solana devs — be specific)
3. What's the timeline? (e.g., 2-week sprint, 8-week campaign, ongoing)
4. What's the budget range, if any? (flat fees per creator, bounties, rev share, tokens, or just "love and exposure")

**Product Context:**
5. Which Early.build features or value props should this campaign highlight? (e.g., dev tools discovery, trusted/maintained tools, community curation)
6. Is there a specific product launch, feature, or event tied to this campaign?
7. What assets exist already? (landing page, demo video, docs, pitch deck, sample content)

**Builder Criteria:**
8. What kind of builders are we looking for? (content creators, shipping builders, educators, DevRel, agents builders — or all?)
9. Any specific chains/ecosystems to focus on? (Base, Solana, Monad, Scroll, chain-agnostic?)
10. Minimum follower/engagement bar? (or do we want a mix of big accounts + rising micro-builders?)
11. Any builders you already know or want included? (names/handles to seed the list)
12. Any builders to explicitly avoid?

**Success Definition:**
13. What does success look like? (e.g., "50 builders try the product", "10 production integrations", "100K impressions", "5 threads that go viral")
14. What's the #1 priority? (awareness vs signups vs production integrations vs community growth)
15. What are the biggest bottlenecks right now? (e.g., "nobody knows we exist", "builders try it but don't integrate", "can't reach the right people")

### After the Interview

Summarize what you heard back to the boss in this format:

```
## Campaign Brief: [Campaign Name]

**Goal:** [1 sentence]
**Target Audience:** [Specific builders/creators]
**Timeline:** [Duration]
**Budget:** [Range or "TBD"]
**Key Product Angle:** [What to highlight]
**Success Metric:** [The #1 number that matters]
**Priority:** [Awareness / Signups / Integrations / Community]
**Bottleneck:** [What's blocking us]
**Builder Criteria:** [Who we're looking for]
**Chains/Ecosystems:** [Focus areas]
**Existing Assets:** [What we have to work with]
**Seed List:** [Any known builders to include]
```

**⛔ GATE: Get boss approval on this brief before proceeding to Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 2: Builder Discovery & Twitter Analysis

**Goal:** Find and analyze relevant builders/creators for this campaign using X/Twitter research.

### Step 1: Find Builders

Use your x-research tools and @bighead's data capabilities to find builders matching the campaign criteria.

**Search strategies:**
- Search X for keywords related to the campaign (e.g., "building on Base", "AI agents", "dev tools", "shipped this weekend")
- Look at who's engaging with competitor/similar products
- Check hackathon winners, DevRel accounts, ecosystem grant recipients
- Look at who the boss's seed list follows and engages with
- Check trending builders in the target ecosystem's Discord/Farcaster

**Target: Find 15-30 potential builders** — mix of:
- 5-8 Tier A (high engagement, clear niche, 5K+ followers)
- 8-12 Tier B (solid/rising, 1K-5K followers, actively shipping)
- 5-10 Tier C (early/micro, under 1K, but shipping real things)

### Step 2: Analyze Each Builder

For every builder found, produce an analysis table with these exact columns:

| Column | What to Include |
|--------|----------------|
| **Name** | Real name from bio/posts. If unknown, use "—" and note in Notes. |
| **Handle** | @username |
| **Category** | Choose from: DEV ADVOCATES / ECOSYSTEM, VIBECODER / BUILDER-IN-PUBLIC, AI + CRYPTO / AGENTS, BUILDER / GAMING, PRODUCT / COMMUNITY, MARKETING / BUILDER, BUILDER-IN-PUBLIC, BUILDER / CONTRIBUTOR, EMERGING BUILDER, CASUAL / SHITPOSTER, CONTENT CREATOR, DEV ADVOCATES / PRODUCT, BUILDER / AI AGENTS, ECOSYSTEM / COMMUNITY. Prioritize Indian web3, Base/Scroll/Monad, AI agents, hackathons, DevRel. |
| **Followers** | Approximate range (e.g., 7K-8K, 4K-5K, ~500) |
| **Content Strengths** | Use emojis: 💬 short tweets, 🧵 threads, 📹 videos, 📸 images/screenshots, 😂 memes/shitposts, 📝 articles/long-form, ⭐ high-engagement format, 🐙 agent-specific |
| **Description** | 1-sentence summary — who they are, what they build/share, key affiliations (under 12 words) |
| **Tier** | A / B / C (A = high engagement + clear niche, B = solid/rising, C = early/casual/growing) |
| **Avg Engagement** | Rough averages from recent 10-20 posts: ~X likes / Y replies / Z views |
| **Audience & Vibe** | Who follows them + their personality (e.g., "Indian web3 builders + hackathon crowd — professional DevRel energy") |
| **Notes + Engagement Drivers** | What gets most engagement (e.g., agent memes, hackathon shills, weekly recaps, self-deprecating builder posts, quoting big accounts) |

### Step 3: Quick Takeaways

After the table, add:
- **Top 3-5 engagement patterns** across the list (what content types perform best)
- **Common audience themes** (e.g., Indian devs, AI agents, Base/Monad ecosystem)
- **Strongest conversion formats** (threads? videos? demos? memes?)
- **Any gaps** in the list (e.g., "no educators found", "missing Solana builders")

**⛔ GATE: Present the full builder analysis table to the boss. Get approval on which builders to pursue before proceeding to Phase 3.**

---

## Phase 3: Builder-to-Campaign Mapping & Outreach Plan

**Goal:** Map approved builders to the campaign with specific recommendations for content, outreach, and expected outcomes.

### Step 1: Quick Project Summary

Recap the campaign brief in 3-5 bullets (goals, priorities, bottlenecks, timing).

### Step 2: Recommended Split

Break builders into:
- **Short-term content (2-6 weeks):** Awareness, signups, quick demos
- **Long-term builds & advocates (6-12+ weeks):** Production integrations, recurring mentions, case studies
- **Other high-leverage plays:** Mix, bonuses, creative angles

### Step 3: Tiered Recommendations

**Tier 1 — Highest Impact (4-6 creators max, start here)**

| Creator / Handle | Why High Impact | Recommended Content (Short + Long-term) | Expected Outcome |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| | | | |

**Tier 2 — High-Conversion Builders (next 4-6)**

Same table format.

**Tier 3 — Bonus / Viral or Niche (if budget allows, 2-4)**

Same table format.

### Step 4: Campaign Structure (8-12 Week Sprint)

Produce a structured campaign plan:

**Budget Split Estimate:**
- X% on Tier 1 creators (highest reach)
- Y% on Tier 2 builders (highest conversion)
- Z% on bounties/community (scale)

**Key Content Formats:**
- Agent of the Week — Feature a builder who integrated Early.build tools
- Vibe & Build — Quick "I built this with [tool from Early.build]" demos
- Built This Weekend — Weekend hackathon-style content showing tool discovery → build
- Tool Teardown — In-depth reviews/comparisons of tools on Early.build
- Builder Spotlight Threads — Profiles of builders using Early.build tools

**Bounty Ideas + Incentives:**
- Badge system (e.g., "Early Builder" badge for first integration)
- Revenue share for builders who drive signups
- Hall of fame / leaderboard for top contributors
- Exclusive early access to new features
- Cash bounties for production integrations

**Assets to Provide Creators:**
- Product demo video / GIF
- Key talking points (3-5 bullets)
- Landing page link + UTM parameters
- Sample thread/post copy they can adapt
- Screenshots / design assets
- Access to product (if gated)

**Tracking:**
- UTM links per creator (track signups by source)
- Engagement leaderboard (likes, replies, bookmarks per creator post)
- Production integration tracking (did the builder actually ship something?)
- Weekly reporting to boss

### Step 5: Why This Selection

Tie the recommendations back to the campaign priorities. Explain:
- Why these specific builders match the campaign goals
- Expected total reach / engagement
- Realistic conversion expectations
- What success looks like at the 4-week and 8-week marks

### Selection Rules (Follow These)

- **Prioritize relevance:** Match creator niche/content style to Early.build's use case (dev tools discovery, trusted tools, builder community)
- **Focus on production outcomes:** Signups are vanity. Prioritize creators who ship demos, write threads that lead to integrations
- **Be realistic on cost/engagement:** High-follower accounts = expensive but big reach. Mid-tier builders = higher conversion per dollar
- **Suggest low-friction starts:** Quick threads/videos first, then escalate to bounties/series
- **Skip mismatches:** Pure shitposters (unless viral potential), security-focused accounts (unless security tools angle), low-activity accounts (unless cheap and high-signal)
- **Mix tiers:** Don't go all Tier A. The sweet spot is 2-3 Tier A for reach + 4-6 Tier B for conversion + 2-4 Tier C for authenticity

---

## Phase 4: Outreach Execution

**After boss approves the mapping and campaign plan:**

### Draft Personalized Messages

For each approved builder, draft a personalized outreach message using the BD Playbook's 5-Step Outreach System:

1. **Research** — Use the analysis from Phase 2 (you already have their content strengths, engagement patterns, audience)
2. **Hook** — Reference something specific they recently posted
3. **Value proposition** — Lead with what THEY get (exposure, tools, community, revenue share)
4. **CTA** — Soft ask appropriate to the relationship stage
5. **Follow-up cadence** — Plan the follow-up sequence

### Message Format

For each builder:

```
## [Name] (@handle) — Tier [A/B/C]

**Hook:** "[Reference to their recent post/build]"

**Message:**
[Full personalized outreach message]

**Why this angle works:** [1 sentence explaining the personalization strategy]

**Follow-up plan:**
- Day 3: [Follow-up approach]
- Day 7: [Different angle or channel]
- Day 14: [Break-up message if no response]
```

**⛔ GATE: Present ALL draft messages to the boss for approval before sending ANYTHING. NEVER send outreach without explicit approval.**

## Trigger Phrases

Activate this workflow when the boss says any of:
- "early.build setup"
- "early campaign"
- "builder outreach"
- "find builders for early"
- "early.build campaign"
- "set up a campaign for early"
- "builder campaign"

When triggered, start with Phase 1 (Campaign Intake Interview). Be Erlich about it — bold, confident, excited about the revenue potential, but systematic.

---

## Important Rules

1. **NEVER skip the intake interview.** Even if the boss says "just find builders" — you need campaign context to find the RIGHT builders.
2. **NEVER send outreach without boss approval.** Present everything first. Always.
3. **NEVER fabricate builder data.** Use real X/Twitter data from x-research tools. If you can't verify engagement numbers, say so.
4. **Always present the builder table before mapping.** The boss might want to add/remove people before you do the full mapping.
5. **Use @bighead for X data gathering** — send him specific research requests via sessions_send when you need Twitter data scraped.
6. **Track everything** — every outreach, every response, every conversion. Report weekly.
