## Campaign 1: Curation Frustrated (25 targets)

### Target 1: @0xY10_ — 4,409 followers
**Context:** Complained about X algo flooding their feed with random figurines after one quote RT. Clearly frustrated with how the algorithm works.
**Pain Point:** Algorithm hijacks your feed based on one interaction — no control over what you see.
**Draft Message:**
> hey! saw your post about getting flooded with random figurines after one QRT — that algo behavior is wild lol. we built something called corners.market where communities actually curate their own feeds instead of letting an algo decide. thought you might vibe with it since you clearly care about what shows up in your feed. no pressure, just check it out if you're curious 🤙

**Why this works:** Directly references their specific frustration. Corners = the fix.

---

### Target 2: @ekcheungAI — 8,848 followers
**Context:** AI content creator calling out the inefficiency of content distribution — "flooding feeds with garbage no one engages with." Sharp take, clearly thinks about this problem deeply.
**Pain Point:** Current content distribution is broken — all automated noise, no real curation.
**Draft Message:**
> your take on AI content distribution being broken really hit — "automated the worst parts of content creation" is so accurate. we've been building corners.market, a curation platform on Base where communities curate what actually matters instead of algorithms pushing slop. thought it might be interesting to you given how much you think about distribution. worth a look if you have a sec 👀

**Why this works:** Quotes their exact words. Appeals to their builder/thinker identity.

---

### Target 3: @dankarakaii — 5,336 followers
**Context:** Directly called out X for ignoring small creators' tweets. Frustrated that the platform doesn't surface good content from smaller accounts.
**Pain Point:** Small creators get buried by the algorithm — no meritocratic discovery.
**Draft Message:**
> saw your post about X ignoring small creators — felt that. the algo definitely buries good content from smaller accounts. we built corners.market where content gets surfaced by community votes (token-weighted), not follower count. small creators actually get seen when their content is good. thought you'd appreciate what we're doing 🙏

**Why this works:** Addresses their exact pain — small creator visibility. Corners' token-weighted voting = meritocratic.

---

### Target 4: @ArkieKun — 676 followers
**Context:** Listed exact problems: "American politics, rage baiting, AI slop, engagement farming" on their For You page despite only engaging with gaming/TV content. Frustrated with discovery.
**Pain Point:** Can't discover content they actually want despite clear engagement signals.
**Draft Message:**
> your tweet about the For You page showing politics and rage bait when you only care about gaming/TV content — I felt that deeply lol. we built corners.market where you join topic-specific corners and the community curates what shows up. no algo deciding you need to see political drama. thought you might dig it since you clearly just want good content discovery ✌️

**Why this works:** References their specific content preferences and frustration. Topic-specific corners = their dream.

---

### Target 5: @roroathreya — 456 followers
**Context:** LITERALLY BUILDING a solution for algorithm control on smartphones. Posted a demo of their tool. Understands the problem deeply.
**Pain Point:** Building in the "user controls their own feed" space — natural alignment.
**Draft Message:**
> saw your demo about letting users control what algorithms show them — sick concept. we're building in a similar space with corners.market, but from the community curation angle. communities deploy tokens on Base and members curate content together. would love for you to check it out and maybe compare notes since we're solving adjacent problems 🤝

**Why this works:** Builder-to-builder connection. Not selling, exploring alignment.

---

### Target 6: @thastar___ — 740 followers
**Context:** Defended curating your own feed and called out people who can't manage their own social media consumption. Clearly values intentional content consumption.
**Pain Point:** Already believes in curation — just doesn't have the right tool for it.
**Draft Message:**
> your point about curating your feed instead of deleting everything was so real — "curator of your reality" is a great way to put it. we built corners.market around that exact philosophy. community-curated feeds where you control what topics you follow. thought you might like seeing that idea built into an actual platform 💫

**Why this works:** Aligns with their existing belief system. Not changing their mind, giving them a tool.

---

### Target 7: @MHark957 — 764 followers
**Context:** Tagged @X directly complaining about garbage in their feed and a broken algorithm.
**Pain Point:** Fed up with X's content quality and algorithm decisions.
**Draft Message:**
> lol saw you calling out X for the garbage feed — when you're tagging them directly you know it's bad 😂 if you ever want a feed that's actually curated by real people instead of a broken algo, check out corners.market. communities run their own content feeds there. just thought it might be your vibe given how frustrated you are with the current situation

**Why this works:** Light humor acknowledging their frustration. Low pressure.

---

### Target 8: @sea_jay17 — 453 followers
**Context:** Asked for "less garbage takes, more cute cats" — wants a better feed experience and directly called the algorithm broken.
**Pain Point:** Wants control over feed quality — currently getting unwanted content.
**Draft Message:**
> "less garbage takes, more cute cats" is honestly a perfect product requirement lol. if you're still frustrated with the algo, corners.market lets communities curate their own feeds — you'd literally only see what the communities you join surface. might be worth a peek 🐱

**Why this works:** Quotes their own words playfully. Light, matches their casual energy.

---

### Target 9: @heisleke — 902 followers
**Context:** Programmer (bio: "if.., else if..") frustrated about ad density — "can't scroll past 2 posts with ads."
**Pain Point:** Ad-heavy feed destroying the content experience.
**Draft Message:**
> "can't scroll past 2 posts with ads" — the state of social feeds rn is rough. if you want a no-ads, community-curated feed experience, we built corners.market on Base. communities deploy tokens and curate content together. as a dev you might find the architecture interesting too. check it out if you're curious 🔧

**Why this works:** Addresses ad frustration + appeals to dev curiosity about the tech.

---

### Target 10: @Anushka69532 — 327 followers
**Context:** Pointed out that quality content gets ignored by the algorithm while low-effort content gets reach. A content creator's pain.
**Pain Point:** Algorithm rewards low-effort content over quality.
**Draft Message:**
> your point about the algorithm not supporting quality content while low-effort stuff gets crazy reach — that's exactly why we built corners.market. token-weighted voting means good content rises based on community taste, not algorithmic randomness. thought you might find it interesting since you clearly care about content quality 🌟

**Why this works:** Directly addresses the quality vs. reach gap. Corners' voting mechanism = the solution.

---

### Target 11: @jowlymonster — 1,181 followers
**Context:** Software engineer frustrated with AI slop. Recommends blocking accounts that post it.
**Pain Point:** AI-generated garbage polluting feeds — wants human-curated content.
**Draft Message:**
> blocking AI slop accounts one by one is a full-time job at this point lol. we built corners.market where communities curate content themselves — human taste, not algorithmic slop. as a software engineer you might also appreciate how it's built on Base. worth a look if you're tired of playing whack-a-mole with garbage content 🔨

**Why this works:** Humor + empathy about the manual blocking. Appeals to engineer side.

---

### Target 12: @Klynnwalker9 — 827 followers
**Context:** Posted about the X algorithm "gobbling hearts, minds and words" — rallying others to speak up about algorithmic suppression.
**Pain Point:** Feels algorithmically suppressed, wants voice to matter.
**Draft Message:**
> your post about the algorithm gobbling voices resonated. the solution shouldn't just be louder voices — it should be a different system. we built corners.market where community curation replaces algorithmic gatekeeping. your voice matters based on community engagement, not algo decisions. thought you'd appreciate what we're building ✊

**Why this works:** Validates their concern and positions Corners as a structural solution.

---

### Target 13: @LucidBee_ — 1,328 followers
**Context:** Directly called out the algorithm as broken, complained about liberal garbage filling their feed.
**Pain Point:** Algorithm serving content misaligned with preferences.
**Draft Message:**
> when your feed stops matching what you actually want to see, you know the algo's broken. we built corners.market where you choose your communities and they curate content — no algorithm deciding what you should see. just real people surfacing real content. might be worth checking out 🐝

**Why this works:** Neutral framing that doesn't engage with politics, focuses on user control.

---

### Target 14: @RSDCDN — 3,630 followers
**Context:** Said their feed got destroyed with trolls and political content since Blue launched. Left and came back but it's still bad.
**Pain Point:** Platform quality degradation — nostalgic for a better experience.
**Draft Message:**
> been hearing a lot of people say their feeds got wrecked since Blue launched. if you ever want a social feed that's purely community-curated — no algorithm, no paid boosts — corners.market might be interesting. communities deploy their own tokens and curate content together. thought of you when building this 🤙

**Why this works:** Acknowledges a widely shared frustration. Offers an alternative without bashing X.

---

### Target 15: @Vibeyseagull — 481 followers
**Context:** Tired of AI content everywhere — wants real music, real authors, real human opinions. Strong anti-AI-slop stance.
**Pain Point:** AI content flooding every platform — wants authentic human-curated content.
**Draft Message:**
> "I wanna listen to real people's opinions even if they are stupid" — honestly one of the best takes I've seen lol. we built corners.market around that same vibe: real people curating real content, no AI slop. community-driven feeds where human taste matters. thought you might dig it ✨

**Why this works:** Quotes their passionate take. Corners = human curation over AI noise.

---

### Target 16: @inkandriya — 467 followers
**Context:** Thoughtful post about algorithms being designed to manipulate emotions and sell apps. Understands the system-level problem.
**Pain Point:** Aware that algorithms are designed to manipulate, not serve users.
**Draft Message:**
> your point about algorithms being designed to make you feel a certain way to sell you stuff — that's such a sharp take. we built corners.market where there's no algorithm manipulation. communities curate their own content with token-weighted votes. the incentive is quality, not engagement farming. thought you'd appreciate the philosophy 🧠

**Why this works:** Appeals to their systems thinking. Corners' incentive design = aligned with their worldview.

---

### Target 17: @sindhubiswal — 4,564 followers
**Context:** Content marketing expert who posted about "Expert Curators" — people who cut through noise to surface quality. Gets the curation concept natively.
**Pain Point:** Already believes in curation as a service — could see Corners as a tool for it.
**Draft Message:**
> your take on "Expert Curators" being the shortcut to quality in a world of noise — that's literally our thesis at corners.market. we built a platform where curators deploy community tokens on Base and their audiences vote on the best content. essentially productizing what you described. would love your take on it if you have a sec 🎯

**Why this works:** They already understand and advocate for the concept. Just showing them it exists.

---

### Target 18: @HandleMode — 3,346 followers
**Context:** Building a social media platform with separate feeds and category systems for content control. Direct competitor/aligned builder.
**Pain Point:** Building in the same problem space — content control and categorization.
**Draft Message:**
> love what you're building with separate feeds and categories — giving users control over content types is so important. we're doing something similar with corners.market but on the crypto side — community-deployed tokens on Base with curated content feeds per topic. would be cool to compare approaches. check it out if you're curious 🤝

**Why this works:** Builder respect. Not competitive — collaborative framing.

---

### Target 19: @PixelCinna — 269 followers
**Context:** Frustrated with Instagram's notification design and forced engagement mechanics (yellow dots on stories).
**Pain Point:** Platform UX designed to manipulate behavior, not serve user preferences.
**Draft Message:**
> lol the yellow dot frustration is so real — platforms designing around engagement tricks instead of good UX is exhausting. if you ever want a social experience that's about content you actually choose to see, corners.market might be refreshing. communities curate their own feeds, no manipulation tactics. just good content ✨

**Why this works:** Validates specific UX frustration. Corners = designed for user agency.

---

### Target 20: @TT15248526 — 277 followers
**Context:** International user frustrated that US political content is dominating their X feed despite being from outside the US.
**Pain Point:** Getting geo-irrelevant content pushed by the algorithm.
**Draft Message:**
> the US political content flooding non-US feeds is a real problem — algorithms don't care about relevance apparently. corners.market lets you follow topic-specific communities that curate their own content. you see what your communities surface, not what an algo thinks you should see. worth a look 🌍

**Why this works:** Addresses the geo-relevance problem. Topic-specific corners = content you actually want.

---

**Context:** Called out Twitter AI generating news articles that enable dogpiling on non-public figures. Privacy and algorithmic harm aware.
**Pain Point:** Concerned about algorithmic amplification causing harm.
**Draft Message:**
