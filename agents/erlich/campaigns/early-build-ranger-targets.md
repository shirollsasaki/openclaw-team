# Early.build / Ranger — Campaign Targets & Strategy
## Feb 2026

---

## Campaign Brief
**Product:** Ranger.net — AI QA testing platform ("QA runs itself")
**Distribution:** Early.build builder network
**Goal:** 500 relevant targets for outreach
**Ideal Profile:** Founders/devs with live shipped products who have QA pain — solo founders, indie hackers, vibe coders, early-stage startup engineers

---

## Target Segments (500 total)

### Segment 1: Solo Founders / Indie Hackers with live products (150 targets)
Signal: Building in public, shipped SaaS/app, posting about distribution/growth problems
Pain: No QA, ship and pray, bugs in production embarrass them
Angle: "You ship fast. Ranger catches what you miss before users do."

Key targets found:
- @alexwtlf (1.8K) — "vibe coded a SaaS... launch day 1000 logins, server crashed instantly"
- @adrien_brbr (396) — "building is my superpower. distribution is my weakness" — ships without QA
- @sarthaktwtt (2.1K) — building SaaS, shares the struggle of shipping
- @justoo_digital (400) — "I ship MVPs that start charging customers in under 3 weeks"
- @Henrylabss (437) — solo founder, "built the modern replacement for Loom", building in public
- @c_aulli (436) — building in public daily, hit bugs on day 27
- @VladArtym (239) — "crafting products to $1M ARR", solo founder
- @its_shubho (329) — 2x founder, values time as greatest asset
- @xxpaat (565) — solo founder debugging AWS in production
- @nihdao (304) — "AI can ship your app in 10 minutes. when it breaks at 3am..."

### Segment 2: Startup Engineers / CTOs who talk about testing pain (150 targets)
Signal: Posting about Playwright, Cypress, manual QA, E2E testing, bugs in prod
Pain: Tests are brittle, manual QA is time-consuming, no budget for QA team
Angle: "Ranger writes the tests. You just ship."

Key targets found:
- @wojakcodes (53.7K) — "client said QA team is testing it... no logs on my server. wtf"
- @MarcJSchmidt (6.7K) — AI LLM "removed tests, refused to write tests, regressions framed as preexisting"
- @BenLesh (62.5K) — "100% code coverage and no integration tests = still broken"
- @ibamarief (18.4K) — evolving QA orgs for 1000+ person teams, QA advocate
- @VicVijayakumar (24.7K) — "not deploying on Friday is a red flag... zero-bug policy"
- @tekbog (37.2K) — "how the bug appears right after you deploy to prod"
- @CoastalFuturist (15.7K) — "Did you test before pushing to prod? No."
- @trashh_dev (113K) — "your friday deploy broke prod over the weekend"
- @jamonholmgren (31.3K) — founder/CTO, 32yr coding veteran, ships with NPM libs never reviewed
- @mmt (912) — "There is no QA, product managers have to test"
- @RaulJuncoV (34.2K) — "I'd rather spend 1hr writing tests than 5hrs fixing bugs in production"
- @0xTib3rius (70.2K) — called out vibe coding without reading code as dangerous
- @absol_89 (549) — Sr. QA Manager, actively posting about bugs

### Segment 3: Build-in-Public Founders (100 targets)
Signal: Ship It Saturday vibes, weekend projects, hackathon participants, BIP culture
Pain: They build fast, ship without testing, users find bugs first
Angle: "Built this in 48hrs. Ranger caught 3 bugs before I shipped."

Key targets found:
- @siyabuilt (10.8K) — "After six months as indiehackers, after two failed products..."
- @om_patel5 (9.8K) — 16yo SaaS dev, building and shipping constantly
- @aryanlabde (4.7K) — "people overestimate building... marketing is the challenge"

- @alexwtlf (1.8K) — "building MVPs in weeks in the vibe coding era"

### Segment 4: AI/Vibe Coders (100 targets)  
Signal: Using Cursor, Claude, v0 to build apps fast — "vibe coding" identity
Pain: They don't write tests. They don't even read their own code. Deploy and pray.
Angle: "You vibe coded it. Ranger tests it."

Key targets found:
- @nihdao (304) — "AI can ship your app in 10 mins. when it breaks at 3am..."
- @Jbm_dev (2K) — "Full-stack Dev, 3x Founder, Building Sansa AI API"

### Segment 5: Hackathon Participants (from doc's beta program targeting) (100 targets)
Signal: Posting about hackathon wins, hackathon builds, deployed apps from events
Pain: Built fast in 48hrs, deployed, never tested
Angle: "Ranger is the official QA partner for early.build hackathons"

Key targets found:
- @0xCL4R (1.1K) — 10x hackathon wins, building fast
- @YashAtreya (1.1K) — built on tempo for Privy x Canteen hackathon
- @aniruddhadak (357) — built SecureOps AI for #2Fast2MCP hackathon

## DM Approach (Dimitar Framework)

### Warm-up Comment (Day 1)
Reference their specific post about shipping/bugs/building. Add a useful take. No pitch.

Examples:
> @wojakcodes — "the 'QA team testing' with zero server logs is the most relatable thing I've seen this week"
> @alexwtlf — "the 1000 logins crash story is brutal — distribution advice without load testing should be illegal"
> @trashh_dev — "the friday deploy prod break is such a universal experience"

### DM (Day 2) — 3 lines max
**Format:**
> [reference their post/pain]
> 
> [what Ranger does — one line]
> 
> ranger.net

**Example DMs:**

@wojakcodes:
> saw your post about the "QA team testing" with zero server logs — classic
> 
> built something that might've caught that: Ranger runs automated E2E tests on your app continuously so you know what's actually broken before users do
> 
> ranger.net

@alexwtlf:
> the vibe-coded SaaS server crash on launch day is a right of passage lol
> 
> Ranger runs automated tests on your live product before you ship — catches the stuff that kills launch days
> 
> ranger.net

@nihdao:
> "AI can ship your app in 10 mins. when it breaks at 3am" — this is the whole problem statement
> 
> Ranger is the answer: always-on AI QA that tests your app continuously so 3am isn't panic time
> 
> ranger.net
