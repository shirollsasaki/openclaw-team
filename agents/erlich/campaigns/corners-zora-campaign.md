# Corners.market — Zora Pivot Campaign
## Feb 2026

---

## Campaign Brief
**Product:** Corners.market — community curation platform on Base
**Trigger:** Zora pivoted to Solana (attention markets). Left Base ecosystem.
**Angle:** NOT "Zora abandoned you." Instead: the conversation around what onchain social should actually be — curation, not speculation.
**Target:** People discussing what the future of onchain social looks like, Base builders frustrated with the direction, and people who wanted creator tools not gambling mechanics.

---

## The Right Angle

Zora's pivot has opened a debate: is onchain social just speculative gambling dressed up as creativity? 

Corners sits in the conversation as the answer to what people ACTUALLY wanted — community-curated content, not attention trading. The pitch is:

> "The attention market debate is interesting. But curation markets? Where communities vote on the best content with token weight and curators earn SAND rewards? That's what we've been building on Base."

Not: "Zora left Base, try us"  
Yes: "Here's what onchain curation actually looks like"

## Target Segments

### Segment 1: People frustrated with speculation-first onchain social (40 targets)
Signal: Posting that onchain social has become "buzzword gambling" / criticizing the attention market model
Pain: Wanted creator economy with substance, not trading mechanics
Angle: Corners = curation with substance. Token-weighted voting rewards quality, not speculation.

Key targets:
- @__proper (11.7K) — "sad that the only way to survive is to turn into buzzword gambling apps"
- @AvgJoesCrypto (17.3K) — "genuinely unique vision... completely abandoned"
- @capradavis (3.4K) — respects Zora's tenacity but understands the pivot
- @blockchainzilla (3.2K) — "best version of Zora was the original one based around artists"
- @munchPRMR (24.4K) — "chain hopping to whatever is popular instead of having conviction"

DM angle:
> saw your take that onchain social is turning into buzzword gambling — agree
> 
> corners.market is trying to do something different: community-curated content on Base with token-weighted voting. curators earn SAND rewards for quality contributions, not speculation
> 
> corners.market

### Segment 2: Base ecosystem builders who feel abandoned (30 targets)
Signal: Builders on Base frustrated with ecosystem direction, feel support dried up
Pain: Invested time and energy into Base, feel let down by the narrative shift
Angle: Corners is still here, still building on Base, still believes in the ecosystem

Key targets:
- @696_eth (9.9K) — "base dropped the ball... stop amplifying BS, support real builders from years ago"
- @LukasMikelionis (2.2K) — journalist building on Base, demoralised by Zora pivot
- @xdthesmiley (2.1K) — builder, "builders are fed up and feel like base is drifting"
- @panik_eth (861) — actual builder, building $BAES on Base, called it a rug
- @0xvedang (596) — "Base is fumbling really bad. No creators focused GTM"
- @LinasLekavicius (6.2K) — building @theworldonbase apps, frustrated with Base support
- @FamKiet (4.4K) — "Zora pivoted without telling the Base community"
- @lexonthechain (3.3K) — "is every Zora creator token useless now?"
- @toastonbase (686) — "shame on everyone that forced creator coins and ruined Base"
- @KienNguyen (15.7K) — "Zora raised $60M and built the worst coin launchpad"

DM angle:
> saw your post about Base losing momentum — felt that
> 
> we're still here building on Base with corners.market — community curation with token-weighted voting. not chasing the latest meta, just building the curation layer Base needs
> 
> corners.market

### Segment 3: Onchain social / creator economy thinkers (30 targets)
Signal: Thoughtful takes on what onchain social should look like, creator economy debates
Pain: Frustrated that every experiment becomes speculation
Angle: Corners = the substance model. Community curation > attention trading.

Key targets:
- @CyberShakti (8.1K) — "building @posterdotfun", called out Zora's blatant creator coin shills years ago
- @UncleHODL (10.2K) — NFT collector, community builder, experienced the Base withdrawal issues
- @KateVassGalerie (7.2K) — "curating systems, not walls" — pioneering in generative & AI art since 2016
- @acidmandoteth (2K) — "MoGraph+Illustration, Exploring Web3, Creator of @aotgoobots"
- @exgenesis (4.9K) — epistemics, running community archive
- @redhairshanks86 (23.9K) — long thoughtful take on creator coin narrative being wrong from the start

DM angle:
> your take on creator coins being the wrong model for onchain social was right from the start
> 
> corners.market takes a different approach — community-curated content on Base with token-weighted voting. creators don't just launch a coin and pray, communities actively curate what's worth seeing
> 
> corners.market

## DM Format (3 lines, warm-up first)

### Template
> [1 line: reference their specific take — quote their words if possible]
> 
> [1-2 lines: what Corners does differently — substance over speculation]
> 
> corners.market

### DO NOT say:
- "Zora left Base" — sounds desperate/demeaning
- "You got rugged by Zora" — too aggressive
- "Looking for a Zora alternative?" — positions us as second choice

### DO say:
- Reference their specific critique of attention markets / speculation / chain hopping
- Position Corners as the thing they were WISHING existed
- Keep it discovery-framed: "this exists, thought you'd find it interesting"
