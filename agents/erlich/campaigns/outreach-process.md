# Corners.market Outreach Process
## Based on Dimitar Angelov's Cold Outreach System (adapted for our use case)

---

## The System (Dimitar's Framework → Our Adaptation)

### Dimitar's Core Structure:
1. **Scrape ICP leads** (Apollo / X search)
2. **Multi-channel outreach** — Email + X DMs + LinkedIn (the "holy trinity")
3. **Comment-first strategy** — Comment genuinely on their posts FIRST, THEN DM
4. **2-liner cold pitch** — Keep messages stupidly short
5. **Fear of falling behind** — Frame around what competitors are doing
6. **Volume + conversion math** — 10K emails → 0.01% = 1 call/day → 10% close = $$$
7. **Sequence, don't single-shot** — Multiple touchpoints across channels

### Key Insight from Dimitar:
> "Reply rates increased 35%+ by doing ONE thing: telling leads to check their DMs. Comment on their post honestly FIRST, not like a desperate shill — then DM."

## Our Adapted Process for Corners.market

### Phase 1: WARM UP (Day 1-2)
**Goal:** Get on their radar before DM-ing

For each target:
1. **Like 2-3 of their recent posts** (genuine ones, not random)
2. **Leave ONE genuine reply** on a relevant post — add value, don't shill
   - Reference something specific they said
   - Add a take, agree with nuance, or ask a smart question
   - NO mention of Corners yet
3. **Follow them** (optional — only if their content is genuinely relevant)

### Phase 2: DM (Day 2-3)
**Goal:** Send the personalized DM after they've seen your name

Rules:
- Keep it to **3-4 short lines MAX** (Dimitar's 2-liner principle)
- Reference the post you commented on
- Bridge to Corners naturally
- End with link, nothing else
- NO "let me know what you think" — just the link

### Phase 3: FOLLOW UP (Day 5-7)
**Goal:** Gentle bump for non-responders

If no reply after 3-4 days:
- Reply to one of their NEW posts with value
- Do NOT send a follow-up DM (too aggressive for casual outreach)
- If they engage with your reply, THEN send a casual follow-up DM:
  > "btw did you get a chance to check that link? no worries if not"

### Phase 4: TRACK (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Know what's working

Track per target:
- [ ] Liked posts
- [ ] Commented on post (which one)
- [ ] DM sent (date)
- [ ] Reply received (Y/N)
- [ ] Clicked link (if trackable)
- [ ] Hot lead (Y/N)

## Message Length Guide (Dimitar's 2-liner adapted)

**WRONG (too long):**
> hey! saw your post about X algorithm flooding your feed with random content. that's so frustrating and we totally get it. we've been building this platform called corners.market where communities actually curate their own content feeds using token-weighted voting on Base chain. thought you might find it interesting since you clearly care about content quality. no pressure at all, just check it out if you're curious!

**RIGHT (tight):**
> saw your post about the algo flooding your feed with random stuff
> 
> we built corners.market — communities curate their own feeds with token-weighted votes on Base. no algo
> 
> corners.market

3 lines. Specific reference. What it is. Link. Done.

## Comment Templates (Phase 1 warm-up)

These are TEMPLATES — always customize with specific context from their post.

**For algorithm frustrated people:**
> "this is exactly why I stopped trusting the For You tab — [specific thing from their post]"

**For Base builders:**
> "solid approach — [specific thing about their project]. Base ecosystem needs more of this"

**For CT curators:**
> "this is genuinely useful — bookmarked. [specific reference to what they curated]"

**For community builders:**
> "community-first approach is underrated — [specific reference]. most people get this backwards"

## Conversion Math (Our version)

100 targets
× 60% DM delivery rate (some have DMs closed) = 60 delivered
× 15% reply rate (personalized + warm-up) = 9 replies
× 33% convert to active user = 3 new active users
× network effect = each brings 2-3 more

**Conservative: 3-5 new active Corners users per 100-target campaign**
**Optimistic: 10-15 if we nail the targeting**

## Account to Send From
TBD — Boss needs to designate which X account sends the DMs

## Tools
- **KooSocial API** — Target mining + tweet search (read-only)
- **Manual sending** — Copy-paste DMs from X account (safest)
- **Tracking** — Google Sheet or Notion (TBD)
