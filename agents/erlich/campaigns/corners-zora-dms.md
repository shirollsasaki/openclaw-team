### 1. @__proper — 11,791 followers
**Their tweet:** "sad that the only way for companies here to survive is to turn into buzzword gambling apps. even zora's last two pivots 'coin everything' and 'trade attention' are the exact same thing, just marketed differently"
**Warm-up comment:** Agree with the rebranding observation — "coin everything" vs "trade attention" really is the same mechanic with a different skin
**DM:**
> "coin everything" and "trade attention" being the same thing differently marketed — that's the clearest take I've seen on this
>
> corners.market is trying to be the non-gambling version of onchain social: community-curated content on Base, token-weighted voting, curators earn SAND rewards for quality contributions
>
> corners.market

### 2. @AvgJoesCrypto — 17,304 followers
**Their tweet:** "Base / Zora's original vision for onchain social was genuinely unique and a breath of fresh air for a space that only builds copycats of the same 5-10 protocols. To see both teams completely abandon their idea and pivot to building copycats within ~6 months is extremely disappointing"
**Warm-up comment:** The "breath of fresh air" observation hits hard — original onchain social vision was genuinely different, which makes the pivot all the more frustrating
**DM:**
> "breath of fresh air for a space that only builds copycats" — that was the right read, which is why the pivot stings
>
> corners.market is still trying to be that thing: community curation on Base where members vote on the best content with token weight, curators earn SAND for quality
>
> corners.market

### 3. @capradavis — 3,433 followers
**Their tweet:** "Chain hopping aside, I think this is the right move for Zora. The Zora team has been SO tenacious in iterating on the creator coin model, but at a certain point there's very little more you can do except pivot. Much respect to @js_horne for this decision."
**Warm-up comment:** Fair take — respecting the tenacity while recognising when a model has run its course is actually good founder thinking
**DM:**
> your point about "very little more you can do except pivot" is the honest framing most people won't give
>
> curious what you think of the curation angle — corners.market is building community-curated content on Base, token-weighted voting. different model from creator coins entirely
>
> corners.market

### 4. @blockchainzilla — 3,240 followers
**Their tweet:** "The best version of Zora was the original one based around artists and NFTs."
**Warm-up comment:** The artist-first NFT version was genuinely different — everything since has been progressively more speculative
**DM:**
> the original artist-first version being the best version — agreed. everything since has been chasing the trading angle
>
> corners.market is trying to keep the community/creator spirit alive on Base — communities curate the best content together, token-weighted voting, no speculation mechanic
>
> corners.market

### 5. @munchPRMR — 24,466 followers
**Their tweet:** "If you are an app that is chain hopping to whatever is most popular instead of having conviction in something you won't survive anyways. Why did Zora initially launch on Base in the first place? Zero"
**Warm-up comment:** "conviction in something" is the exact thing that's been missing — chain hopping is a symptom of not having a defensible thesis
**DM:**
> "chain hopping to whatever is most popular instead of having conviction" — zero, as you put it
>
> corners.market has been building the same thing on Base since day one: community curation, token-weighted voting, SAND rewards for quality contributors. no chain hops, no pivots
>
> corners.market

### 6. @696_eth — 9,989 followers
**Their tweet:** "ngl base really dropped the ball in 2025. with their zora, posts and creator coins bullshit. forcing a narrative nobody wanted. not amplifying real builders and already existing memes that have been building on the chain for YEARS. i want to see them do better in 2026. stop bs"
**Warm-up comment:** "forcing a narrative nobody wanted" while ignoring builders who've been there for years — that's the exact disconnect that's frustrated people
**DM:**
> "not amplifying real builders who've been on the chain for years" — that frustration is real
>
> corners.market has been building on Base — community curation with token-weighted voting. not a narrative push, just building. check it out if you want to see what's actually shipping
>
> corners.market

### 7. @LukasMikelionis — 2,272 followers
**Their tweet:** "Honestly it's demoralising seeing Zora just pivot to Solana after the Base team pushed HARD. I sought any whatsoever Base support for Pubhouse - any amplification. I submitted forms multiple times, approached marketing materials, asked Jesse and others multiple times via FC"
**Warm-up comment:** Building something on Base and watching the flagship project leave while you got radio silence from the team — that's genuinely demoralising
**DM:**
> building on Base, submitting forms, getting no support, then watching the flagship protocol leave — that's a rough sequence
>
> corners.market is still on Base, still building. if you want to get Pubhouse in front of a community that actually curates and surfaces good content, worth checking out
>
> corners.market

### 8. @xdthesmiley — 2,102 followers
**Their tweet:** "@base @jessepollak i keep seeing 'appreciate the feedback, we'll learn and iterate' but you've been pushing the same narrative for a year. if you look at CT, it's obvious a ton of builders are fed up and feel like base is drifting away from what actually matters. stop making"
**Warm-up comment:** "appreciate the feedback, we'll iterate" after a year of the same direction — that gap between stated intention and actual output is what frustrates builders
**DM:**
> "builders are fed up and feel like base is drifting from what actually matters" — this is the real story
>
> corners.market is one of the things still building on Base without pivoting. community curation, token-weighted voting, SAND rewards. if you want to see what's actually shipping on Base, check it out
>
> corners.market

### 9. @panik_eth — 861 followers
**Their tweet:** "and there it is. the long-awaited zora sunset tweet. of course, they don't call it a sunset. they call it iteration. months of draining liquidity out of @base, months of retail getting chopped while everyone was told this was the future, and now it's just… a rug."
**Warm-up comment:** "they don't call it a sunset, they call it iteration" — that reframe is doing a lot of heavy lifting
**DM:**
> "months of draining liquidity while retail was told this is the future, now it's just a rug" — that's the most honest summary
>
> you're building on Base still — so are we with corners.market. community curation, token-weighted voting. no liquidity draining, just building. thought you'd want to know
>
> corners.market

### 10. @0xvedang — 596 followers
**Their tweet:** "Base is fumbling really bad. No airdrop this year. No creators focused gtm strategies. Misaligned zora revamp. Regressive mini app change. What's wrong with the ecosystem??"
**Warm-up comment:** The list format says it all — when you can name four distinct fumbles, that's a pattern not a coincidence
**DM:**
> "no creators focused GTM strategies" — that's the one that stings most for builders actually making things
>
> corners.market is the creator-focused layer Base should've been supporting: community curation, token-weighted voting, SAND rewards for contributors. still on Base, still building
>
> corners.market

### 11. @LinasLekavicius — 6,293 followers
**Their tweet:** "@baseapp: 'heyy you should build on Base it's awesome we will help you with everything.' @baseapp after you point them a Base app bug which prevents you from launching your miniapp: 'honestly we won't fix it anytime soon, try to see if there's any workaround' 🤡"
**Warm-up comment:** "we will help you with everything" → "find a workaround" is a very specific kind of betrayal
**DM:**
> the "we'll help with everything" → "find a workaround" pipeline is painfully relatable
>
> corners.market is still on Base — community curation platform where communities deploy tokens and curate content. might be worth knowing what's actually shipping on Base while you figure out the miniapp situation
>
> corners.market

### 12. @FamKien — 4,431 followers
**Their tweet:** "Zora silently pivoted without telling the Base community even a word. I think this deserves communication from the Base team as well."
**Warm-up comment:** The silence is what makes it worse — pivoting is one thing, ghosting your community while doing it is another
**DM:**
> "silently pivoted without telling the Base community a word" — the communication failure is almost worse than the pivot itself
>
> corners.market is still on Base and still communicating — community curation with token-weighted voting, SAND rewards. no silent pivots here
>
> corners.market

### 13. @lexonthechain — 3,305 followers
**Their tweet:** "is every $zora creator token simply useless atm? did they even remove it from the Zora client by cutting Base entirely?"
**Warm-up comment:** The creator token question is the one nobody from Zora seems to want to answer directly
**DM:**
> the creator token question getting no clear answer is a pattern at this point
>
> corners.market takes a different approach — communities deploy tokens on Base and use them to curate content together, token-weighted voting. the token has a function beyond speculation
>
> corners.market

### 14. @toastonbase — 686 followers
**Their tweet:** "Ridiculous. Shame on Base, shame on everyone that forced creator coins and ruined Base for over a year."
**Warm-up comment:** "Forced creator coins" is the exact framing — it was pushed as the narrative when the ecosystem wanted something else
**DM:**
> "forced creator coins and ruined Base for over a year" — that's the honest take most people won't say directly
>
> corners.market is doing community curation on Base — token-weighted voting, SAND rewards for quality content. the token has purpose beyond the launch
>
> corners.market

### 15. @KienNguyen — 15,704 followers
**Their tweet:** "Zora raised $60M to build what might be the worst coin launchpad in Web3. Meanwhile, Base native launchpads like Clanker, Cliza, and Flaunch raised $0 and still delivered way better platforms."
**Warm-up comment:** The zero-raise bootstrapped platforms out-delivering the $60M-backed one is the most damning data point in this whole saga
**DM:**
> "$0 raised, still delivered way better" — the capital efficiency argument writes itself
>
> corners.market is also building on Base without a $60M budget — community curation, token-weighted voting, SAND rewards. if you're tracking what's actually worth watching on Base, thought this should be on your list
>
> corners.market

### 16. @jacek0x — 5,249 followers
**Their tweet:** "Really disappointing to watch @zora pivot into a Solana attention market. Just chasing the latest meta. After getting support from the entire @base team for the better part of a year, they capitulated the second the trade changed. Low conviction, questionable morals, rinse users"
**Warm-up comment:** "Capitulated the second the trade changed" is exactly it — conviction is the thing that was always missing
**DM:**
> "capitulated the second the trade changed. low conviction, questionable morals" — the clearest take on this
>
> corners.market hasn't pivoted. still building community curation on Base — token-weighted voting, SAND rewards for quality contributors. no meta-chasing
>
> corners.market

### 17. @redhairshanks86 — 23,919 followers
**Their tweet:** "dear @jessepollak, i used to like you a lot, bc i thought you were a genuine builder, but after your zora grift i lost a lot of respect for you. you tried to convince all of CT that your mid-curve, stupid idea to 'tokenise content' on zora as opposed to..."
**Warm-up comment:** The distinction between genuine building and narrative-pushing is the thing a lot of people couldn't articulate — this thread does it
**DM:**
> the "tokenise content" narrative being pushed without the substance to back it — that's the core of what people are frustrated with
>
> corners.market is trying to do the substance version: community-curated content on Base with token-weighted voting. no celebrity shilling, just building
>
> corners.market

### 18. @ruggedpikachu — 4,692 followers
**Their tweet:** "Fuck you Zora. Fuck you base. Go to hell. 50$ airdrop for 2 years usage and >100tx. I spent more in fees than I got here. Never again"
**Warm-up comment:** The math of "spent more in fees than the airdrop value" is the most concrete way to describe how badly this went
**DM:**
> spent more in fees than the airdrop value — that's the clearest possible statement of how this went
>
> if you're still on Base, corners.market is building something different: community curation where curators earn SAND rewards for surfacing quality content. no fee traps
>
> corners.market

### 19. @MoneyLord — 95,731 followers
**Their tweet:** "Never again I'm buying a creator coin on Zora. Incompetence from Zora/base team is unreal. They are out of touch with how onchain works"
**Warm-up comment:** "Out of touch with how onchain works" from someone who's clearly been in onchain long enough to know — that's a specific critique
**DM:**
> "out of touch with how onchain works" — and the creator coin pivot to attention market is proving the same point twice
>
> corners.market is trying to do onchain curation differently: community-deployed tokens on Base, token-weighted voting, SAND rewards. worth a look if you haven't written off Base entirely
>
> corners.market

### 20. @CyberShakti — 8,110 followers
**Their tweet:** "Ok but who here remembers zora was, for one hot minute also an L2. I got blocked 2 years back when I called out their OP retro funding scams. I also got roasted for calling out the blatant creator coin shills. Now I'm just gonna sit back and watch the show"
**Warm-up comment:** Being right about both the L2 pivot and the creator coin hype years ahead of time and getting blocked for it — the timeline vindicates the critics
**DM:**
> called out the creator coin shills two years ago and got blocked for it — the timeline has fully vindicated you
>
> corners.market is building what should've been the model all along: community curation on Base, token-weighted voting, SAND for quality contributions. curious what you think given you've been watching this space closely
>
> corners.market

### 21. @KateVassGalerie — 7,276 followers
**Their tweet:** "Collecting Art Onchain is the first chapter of an ongoing, non-profit initiative dedicated to cultural preservation, human authorship, and the long-term stewardship of digital art. The project is grounded in a simple conviction: culture should not be confined to centralised..."
**Warm-up comment:** "Culture should not be confined to centralised" — the preservation angle is exactly what the speculation-first model ignores
**DM:**
> "culture should not be confined to centralised" — that conviction is what the attention market model ignores entirely
>
> corners.market is trying to build the community curation layer for that world: token-weighted voting on Base, communities decide what's worth preserving and surfacing
>
> corners.market

### 22. @UncleHODL — 10,238 followers
**Their tweet:** "I hit decent when ZachXBT posted on Zora and didn't realize it was tokenized, but then the funds were stuck on Zora for 2+ months because they didn't support base chain withdrawals"
**Warm-up comment:** Funds stuck for 2+ months because they didn't support their own chain's withdrawals — the operational execution has been as bad as the strategic direction
**DM:**
> funds stuck for 2+ months because they didn't support Base chain withdrawals — operational execution matching the strategic direction
>
> corners.market is built on Base and stays on Base — community curation, token-weighted voting. no withdrawal issues, no chain switches
>
> corners.market

### 23. @PopPunkOnChain — 31,007 followers
**Their tweet:** "Base token on Zora was HORRIFICALLY sniped. From a quick look, here's 2 wallets that purchased 21% of the supply for 2 ETH. They then transferred to other wallets and sold for $300k profit. This is what can happen if you don't have snipe protection..."
**Warm-up comment:** 21% sniped on launch, $300k extracted — and this was the flagship token from the flagship protocol on Base
**DM:**
> 21% sniped immediately on the Base token launch — and this was the flagship protocol doing the flagship launch
>
> corners.market deploys community tokens on Base with 3% trading fee and MEV protection built in. different approach to the token mechanic entirely
>
> corners.market

### 24. @dippy_eth — 42,135 followers
**Their tweet:** "@munchPRMR I think Zora went Base because that's where they saw the real early action."
**Warm-up comment:** Opportunistic chain selection in both directions — came for the early action, left when the action moved elsewhere
**DM:**
> came for the early action, leaving when the action moved — that's the whole story of Zora and Base
>
> corners.market picked Base and is staying — community curation platform, token-weighted voting, SAND rewards. still building here while others move on
>
> corners.market

### 25. @acidmandoteth — 2,038 followers
**Their tweet:** "GoodVibesClub is THE CLUB for anyone in NFTs/Web3... In Discord, there's no token-gated chat, there's no separation. Rock your old pfp, we don't care, no purchase necessary, just bring good vibes."
**Warm-up comment:** The "no purchase necessary, just bring good vibes" model is the community-first approach that got buried under tokenisation mania
**DM:**
> "no purchase necessary, just bring good vibes" — community-first approach is what got lost in the creator coin mania
>
> corners.market is building something with that same spirit but onchain: communities curate content together with token-weighted voting, curators earn SAND for quality contributions
