## Compiled: Feb 2026
## Total: 70 targets

## What This Is
People who have distribution on Base/crypto Twitter and are primed to talk about Corners.
Segment 1 = Zora pivot frustration angle (onchain social influencers, Base builders)
Segment 2 = Curation frustrated (people fed up with algo-driven feeds)

---

## Segment 1: Base / Onchain Social — Zora Frustration (0)
*Angle: Position Corners as the substance model vs speculation. Not "Zora abandoned you" — "here's what you've been looking for."*

## Segment 2: Curation Frustrated (70)
