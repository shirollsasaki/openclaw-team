### FOR GRANTS (Non-Equity Funding)
**Simpler, Usually Requires:**
- Project description (what you're building)
- How grant funds will be used (budget breakdown)
- Expected outcomes/milestones
- Timeline (when you'll deliver what)
- Social impact (if applicable)
- Open-source component (if applicable)

**Example Budget Breakdown:**
```
$10K grant request:
- $5K: Cloud infrastructure (AWS/hosting)
- $3K: API costs (Anthropic, OpenAI)
- $2K: Marketing/user acquisition
```

### FOR CREDITS PROGRAMS (Anthropic, AWS, etc.)
**Easiest — Usually Just:**
- Company name
- Website
- What you're building (1 paragraph)
- How you'll use their product (specific use case)
- Current monthly usage (if any)
- Expected usage (estimate)
- Company stage
- Funding raised (if any)

**Anthropic-Specific Example:**
```
Q: How are you using Claude?
A: "ClawDeploy runs 6 autonomous agents per customer workspace, 
   all powered by Claude Sonnet. Each agent maintains context 
   across 200K tokens. Current usage: ~500K tokens/day across 
   X customers. With credits, we'd scale to 100 customers = 
   5M tokens/day."
```

### FOR CORPORATE PROGRAMS (Salesforce, Intel, etc.)
**Similar to Credits, Plus:**
- How does your product integrate with theirs?
- Target customer overlap?
