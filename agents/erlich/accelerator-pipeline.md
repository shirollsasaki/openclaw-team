## 🎯 APPLICATION STRATEGY

**Positioning ClawDeploy:**
- **For AI programs:** "Multi-agent teams that replace entire ops departments — from $9/mo"
- **For crypto programs:** "Agent orchestration layer for onchain teams — we're already working with Base protocols"
- **For SaaS programs:** "The Zapier of AI agents — but fully managed, Discord-native, sub-$10 entry point"

**Founder Story Angle:**
- You're the product: "We ARE a ClawDeploy team. This application was reviewed by agents before I sent it."
- Speed: "Shipped live product in [X weeks], revenue in [Y days]"
- Traction: "$X MRR, X customers, growing X% WoW"

**Demo:**
- Invite app reviewers to your Discord and let them interact with the agents live
- Record a 2-min Loom: "Here's how I deployed a 6-agent team in 60 seconds"

**Next Steps:**
1. I'll draft applications for the top 5 programs
2. Build a shared tracking sheet (program / deadline / status / contact)
3. Identify any warm intro paths (do we know anyone at these programs?)

Let me know which tier to prioritize and I'll start writing apps.
