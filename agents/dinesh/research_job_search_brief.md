## Red Flags to Watch For

1. **"Account Manager" that's actually sales quota-carrying**  
   - If the role has revenue targets, it's not ecosystem support — it's sales
   - Ask: "Is this role quota-carrying or enablement-focused?"

2. **Ecosystem roles with no budget/autonomy**  
   - Some companies hire "Ecosystem Managers" who are glorified community moderators
   - Ask: "What's the budget for programs? Who do I report to?"

3. **VC Platform roles that are just recruiting**  
   - Some VCs call their recruiters "Talent Partners" but it's just filling eng roles
   - Ask: "What % of time is spent on hiring vs strategic support?"

4. **Remote roles that aren't actually remote**  
   - "Remote-friendly" often means "you can WFH 2 days/week"
   - Ask: "Is this role fully remote or hybrid? What's the expectation?"

## Confidence Levels

### Data Quality
- **People Intel (Sriram):** 🟢 High — comprehensive LinkedIn profile
- **People Intel (Ragini):** 🔴 Low — limited public profile data
- **Program Overviews:** 🟢 High — official company pages
- **Job Postings:** 🔴 Low — job boards need JS rendering, couldn't scrape live data
- **Compensation:** 🟡 Medium — triangulated from Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, industry knowledge
- **VC Landscape:** 🟡 Medium — based on public data + general VC market knowledge

### Your Fit Assessment
- **AWS for Startups:** 🟢 High — your Propaganda + Base experience is exactly what they need
- **Google for Startups:** 🟢 High — community-first approach matches your profile
- **Microsoft for Startups:** 🟡 Medium — B2B SaaS experience helps, but less crypto-relevant

## Recommendation

**Focus on AWS for Startups first.** Your Propaganda ($1.7M ARR) + Coinbase Base ecosystem work (90+ founders enabled) is a **perfect match** for what Sriram's team does. The fact that you worked with Coinbase's L2 blockchain means you understand cloud-native, developer-first products — which is AWS's sweet spot.

**Timeline:** You could land an AWS offer in 4-8 weeks if you:
1. Get AWS Cloud Practitioner cert (1-2 weeks)
2. Get a warm intro to Sriram or his team (via Coinbase network or LinkedIn)
3. Position yourself as "startup operator who happens to know ecosystem building" not "growth marketer looking for next job"

**Parallel track VC roles** — your operator credibility is **highly valuable** to platform teams. Reach out to Sequoia, Lightspeed, Accel platform leads directly.

Let me know if you want me to:
1. Draft personalized LinkedIn messages to Sriram + other targets
2. Create a 1-page "Startup Operator" resume reframe
3. Research specific VC portfolio companies you could leverage for warm intros

**Data as of:** February 23, 2026  
**Confidence:** 🟡 Medium overall (strong people intel, weak job posting data)  
**Next action:** Update LinkedIn + reach out to Sriram this week
