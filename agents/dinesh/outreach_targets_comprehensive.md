# FINAL NOTES

## DO's
✅ Personalize every message (mention their specific work, company, or portfolio)  
✅ Lead with your operator credibility (Propaganda ARR, Coinbase Base ecosystem)  
✅ Be specific about what you're looking for ("ecosystem roles", "platform roles")  
✅ Follow up once after 5-7 days if no response  
✅ Offer value (share ecosystem insights, not just ask for job)

## DON'Ts
❌ Don't send generic "I'm looking for a job" messages  
❌ Don't spam multiple people at same company on same day  
❌ Don't follow up more than twice (looks desperate)  
❌ Don't apply to jobs without reaching out to hiring manager first  
❌ Don't forget to track your outreach in a spreadsheet

---

**Next Action:** Start with Sriram Santhanam tomorrow (Monday). Send both LinkedIn message + email. Track in spreadsheet. Report back on responses after 48 hours.

Let me know if you need:
1. More specific people names at any company (I can manually search LinkedIn)
2. Revised message templates for specific situations
3. Cover letter templates for formal applications
