I'm exploring AWS for Startups India because:

1. Scale: 20,000+ startup accounts means massive impact potential
2. Mission alignment: I've spent 3 years helping founders scale (Propaganda, Coinbase Base)
3. Ecosystem-first: Your partnership model with VCs, incubators, government matches how I think about startup support
4. Cloud + AI enablement: My recent 7-agent AI infrastructure project ($55k revenue) showed me how powerful cloud-native tools are for startups

I want to leverage my operator experience (scaled 3 products from 0→revenue) to help India's next wave of founders build on AWS.
```

☐ **"Why AWS" doc created**

## ✅ STEP 9: PREP TALKING POINTS (15 minutes)

### For "Tell me about yourself" (30-second version)

**Practice this out loud 3 times:**

```
I'm a startup operator who's scaled three products from zero to revenue over the last 3 years.

Most recently, I built Propaganda — scaled it to $1.7M ARR in 12 months, working with clients like Coinbase, Arbitrum, and Aptos.

Before that, I led ecosystem programs at Coinbase's Base blockchain, helping 90+ founders raise capital and go-to-market. I also scaled Ideas91 from 0 to $8.2M ARR in 11 months doing B2B supply chain.

What I love is the 0→1 phase — helping founders find product-market fit, build communities, and scale. That's why I'm exploring ecosystem roles where I can do that at a larger scale.
```

**Practice now:** Say it out loud 3x until it feels natural

☐ **Talking points practiced**
