# ALL EMAIL ADDRESSES - READY TO SEND
**Total: 45+ emails across AWS, Google, Microsoft, VCs**  
**Date:** February 23, 2026

⚠️ **CRITICAL: DO NOT SEND ALL AT ONCE**

## Recommended Sending Strategy:
- **Day 1 (Monday):** AWS Tier 1 (8 emails) - PRIMARY TARGETS
- **Day 2 (Tuesday):** Google + Microsoft (10-12 emails)
- **Day 3 (Wednesday):** VCs Tier 1 (10 emails)
- **Days 4-5:** Remaining VCs + follow-ups

**Why:** Sending 40+ emails in one day will flag your account as spam and tank response rates.
