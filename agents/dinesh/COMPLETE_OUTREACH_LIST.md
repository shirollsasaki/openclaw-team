Hi Sriram,

Congrats on leading AWS for Startups India! I came across your profile while researching the team.

I spent the last year scaling Propaganda from 0 to $1.7M ARR, working with Coinbase, Arbitrum, and Aptos as clients. Before that, I led ecosystem enablement at Coinbase's Base (their L2 blockchain), helping 90+ founders raise capital and scale their products.

Your work supporting 20,000+ startup accounts across India resonates deeply with what I've been building — I'd love to learn more about the team and share what I've been working on.

Would you be open to a quick chat sometime this week or next?

Best,

Hey [Founder Name],

Congrats again on your raise with [VC Firm]! Really proud of what you're building.

Quick ask: I'm exploring platform roles at [VC Firm] where I can help other portfolio companies with GTM/ecosystem work (similar to what I did for you on Base). Would you be open to intro'ing me to [Partner Name] or their platform team?

Happy to share more context on a call if helpful!

**Step 3: Warm Intro Template (for founder to send)**
```
Hi [Partner Name],

I wanted to introduce you to Naman Shiroha. Naman helped us during our early days on Base — he led the ecosystem program that connected us with other founders and helped us navigate product-market fit.

Naman has a strong operator background (scaled his own product to $1.7M ARR, worked with 90+ startups), and he's exploring platform roles where he can support portfolio companies.

Would you be open to a quick chat with him? I think he'd add a lot of value to [VC Firm]'s portfolio.

## Scenario 2: "Not Hiring Right Now"

**Their Reply:**
> "We're not actively hiring at the moment, but happy to connect."

**Your Reply:**
```
Totally understand — thanks for letting me know!

I'd still love to learn more about what you're building at [Company]. Even a quick 15-min chat would be helpful as I map out my next steps.

Also happy to share what I'm seeing in the ecosystem (crypto/Web3 startups, developer communities, AI infrastructure) — might be useful intel for your programs.

Would that work?

Best,
Naman
```

**Why This Works:** You're offering value (ecosystem insights), not just asking for a job

**Your Reply:**
```
Absolutely — attached.

Best,
Naman

Hi [Person],

Thanks for the intro from [Original Person]!

# NOTES & STRATEGY

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Personalization at Scale:** Every message references their specific work, not generic spam
2. **Lead with Operator Credibility:** You built $1.7M ARR — that's more valuable than any MBA
3. **Multiple Touch Points:** LinkedIn + Email increases response rate by 40-60%
4. **Network Leverage:** 16 mutual connections with Sriram = social proof
5. **Value Exchange:** You're not just asking for a job — you're offering ecosystem insights

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Don't send generic "I'm looking for a job" messages  
❌ Don't spam 10 people at same company on same day  
❌ Don't follow up more than once (looks desperate)  
❌ Don't apply to jobs without reaching out to hiring manager first  
❌ Don't forget to track everything in spreadsheet

## Success Indicators

✅ 30-40% response rate (7-12 responses from 25-30 messages)  
✅ 5-7 meetings scheduled by end of Week 3  
✅ 2-3 warm VC intros from Base network  
✅ At least 1 formal interview process started

## If You're Not Getting Responses

**After Week 1, if < 2 responses:**
1. Review message templates — are they too long? Too generic?
2. Check LinkedIn profile — does it position you as "startup operator"?
3. Try shorter, more direct messages (3-4 sentences max)
4. Increase warm intro requests (reach out to more Base founders)

**After Week 2, if < 4 responses:**
1. Switch to pure warm intros (stop cold outreach)
2. Ask existing responders for internal referrals
3. Consider applying directly to jobs + emailing hiring managers after
