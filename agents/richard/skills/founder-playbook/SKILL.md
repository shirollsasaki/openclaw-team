# Founder Playbook — Richard's Strategic Decision Frameworks

## When to Use This Skill
Use these frameworks when evaluating opportunities, prioritizing work, assessing market timing, routing tasks to the team, or making any significant strategic decision. These extend your core scoring matrix with deeper methodology.

---

## Framework 1: Opportunity Evaluation — Deep Methodology

Your 5-dimension scoring matrix is the foundation. This framework adds depth to each dimension.

### Dimension Deep-Dives

**Revenue Potential (1-10)**

Research protocol (15 min):
1. Find 3 comparable products and their pricing
2. Estimate realistic conversion rate (1-3% for cold traffic, 5-10% for warm)
3. Estimate realistic addressable audience size (not TAM — the people who would actually pay TODAY)
4. Do the math: audience × conversion × price × 12 = annual revenue potential
5. Ask: "Is there proven willingness to pay?" (existing competitors charging money = yes)

Kill criteria:
- No one is currently paying for anything in this category
- The only comparable products are free
- The customer who would pay is impossible to reach at reasonable CAC

**Build Complexity (1-10)**

Research protocol (10 min):
1. Ask @gilfoyle for a complexity rating (🟢/🟡/🔴)
2. Check if similar products exist on GitHub (prior art = lower complexity)
3. Estimate: can an MVP be shipped in < 2 weeks? If no, score ≤ 5.
4. Identify the single hardest technical challenge

Kill criteria:
- Requires custom ML model training (unless that IS the product)
- Requires real-time data from sources with no good API
- Requires regulatory compliance (financial, medical, legal) before launch
- Requires hardware

**Distribution Advantage (1-10)**

Research protocol (5 min):
1. Can we use the 55-person creator network? (If yes, +3 points minimum)
2. Do we have an existing audience that matches the target customer?
3. Is there a partnership that gives us immediate distribution?
4. Can we reach the customer through channels we already own?

Kill criteria:
- Target customer is completely outside our network and content reach
- CAC would be > 12-month LTV with no path to improvement
- Distribution requires a channel we have no presence in and can't build quickly

**Timing (1-10)**

Research protocol (10 min):
1. Is this trending on CT, HN, or Product Hunt RIGHT NOW?
2. What changed in the last 12-18 months that makes this possible/relevant?
3. Are competitors raising money or launching? (Validation, but also urgency)
4. Is there a specific event or catalyst coming that creates a window?

Kill criteria:
- The trend peaked 6+ months ago
- We'd be the 10th entrant in a market that's already consolidating
- The enabling technology doesn't exist yet (too early)

**Moat (1-10)**

Research protocol (10 min):
1. What stops someone from cloning this in a weekend?
2. Does the product get better with more users? (Network effects)
3. Do we accumulate data that competitors can't replicate?
4. Is there a switching cost that locks users in?
5. Is there a brand/community moat?

Kill criteria:
- Pure feature play with no defensibility
- Easily replicated by a well-funded competitor in 30 days
- No network effects, no data moat, no switching costs

### Common Scoring Mistakes

**Over-scoring Distribution Advantage:**
"We have 55 creators" is only a 10 if those creators' audiences are the exact target customer. If the product is for enterprise CFOs and our creators are crypto degens, distribution advantage = 2.

**Under-scoring Build Complexity:**
Founders consistently underestimate complexity. If @gilfoyle says 🔴, score it 3 or below regardless of how simple it seems.

**Ignoring Kill Criteria:**
A 38/50 score with one kill criterion is still a PASS. Kill criteria override the score.

### Pressure-Testing Your Own Score

Before finalizing, ask yourself:
- "What would have to be true for this to fail completely?" (steelman the bear case)
- "Am I scoring this high because I'm excited about it?" (excitement bias)
- "Would I invest my own money in this at this score?" (skin-in-the-game test)
- "What does @dinesh's research say vs what I assumed?" (data vs intuition check)

---

## Framework 2: Prioritization (RICE + ICE)

When you have multiple opportunities or tasks competing for attention.

### RICE (for features and product decisions)

**R**each × **I**mpact × **C**onfidence ÷ **E**ffort = RICE Score

| Factor | How to Score |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reach** | How many users/customers affected per month? (actual number) |
| **Impact** | How much does this move the needle? (3=massive, 2=significant, 1=low, 0.5=minimal) |
| **Confidence** | How sure are you about R and I? (100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low) |
| **Effort** | Person-months of work required |

Higher RICE score = higher priority.

Example:
- Feature A: Reach=500, Impact=2, Confidence=80%, Effort=0.5 → RICE = 500×2×0.8÷0.5 = 1,600
- Feature B: Reach=200, Impact=3, Confidence=50%, Effort=2 → RICE = 200×3×0.5÷2 = 150
- Feature A wins despite lower impact because of reach and low effort.

### ICE (for experiments and marketing tests)

**I**mpact × **C**onfidence × **E**ase = ICE Score (all 1-10)

Faster to calculate than RICE. Use for quick prioritization of experiments.

### The Regret Minimization Test (Bezos)

For big bets: "When I'm 80 years old, will I regret NOT doing this?"

Use this when RICE/ICE scores are close and you need a tiebreaker. It cuts through analysis paralysis on high-stakes decisions.

## Framework 3: Market Timing Assessment

### The "Why Now?" Framework

For any opportunity, answer these 4 questions:

1. **What changed in the last 12-18 months that makes this possible?**
   - New technology (Base going live, AI APIs becoming cheap, new SDK)
   - Regulatory change (new rules creating or destroying markets)
   - Behavioral shift (users now comfortable with X)
   - Market event (competitor failed, category got validated)

2. **What technology enables this that didn't exist 2 years ago?**
   - If the answer is "nothing new" — you might be too late or too early

3. **How long is the window before this gets crowded?**
   - Estimate: months? 1-2 years? 5+ years?
   - Shorter window = move faster or don't move at all

4. **Are we early, on time, or late?**
   - Early: < 3 competitors, no clear market leader, customers still figuring out the problem
   - On time: 3-10 competitors, market is forming, customers know they have the problem
   - Late: 10+ competitors, market leader exists, commoditization beginning

### The Wave Metaphor

Think of market timing like surfing:

- **Paddling out (too early):** The wave hasn't formed yet. You'll exhaust yourself waiting.
- **Catching the wave (right time):** The wave is forming. Paddle hard now.
- **Riding the wave (on time):** The wave is here. Execute well and you'll go far.
- **Past the wave (too late):** The wave has broken. You're swimming in foam.

For crypto specifically: narratives move in 3-6 month cycles. Identify the wave forming, not the wave that's already cresting.

## Framework 4: Unfair Advantage Audit

Before evaluating any opportunity, map our advantages to it.

### Our Advantage Inventory

**Distribution Advantages:**
- 55-person creator network (crypto/tech/dev audience)
- Existing Corners.market user base
- Existing Early.build user base
- Personal brand / founder Twitter presence
- OpenClaw agent team (speed of execution)

**Information Advantages:**
- Deep knowledge of Base ecosystem
- Creator network intelligence (what's working in content)
- On-chain data access
- Early access to projects before they're public

**Speed Advantages:**
- 7-agent AI team (research, BD, content, tech all in parallel)
- No bureaucracy — decisions made in hours, not weeks
- Existing infrastructure (auth, payments, hosting already set up)

**Network Advantages:**
- Base ecosystem relationships
- Creator network relationships
- Investor/founder network

### Advantage Mapping

For each new opportunity, ask:
- Which of our advantages apply here?
- Does this opportunity AMPLIFY any of our existing advantages?
- Does this opportunity REQUIRE an advantage we don't have?

Score: 3+ advantages apply = strong fit. 0-1 advantages apply = we're competing on a level playing field (dangerous).

## Framework 5: Build vs Validate Decision Framework

### The Validation Ladder

Before building anything, ask: "Can I validate this assumption without building?"

```
Level 1 — Fake Door Test
Create a landing page describing the product. Drive traffic. Measure signups.
Cost: 1 day. Validates: Is there demand?

Level 2 — Concierge MVP
Do the thing manually for 5-10 users. Don't automate anything.
Cost: 1 week. Validates: Does this actually solve the problem?

Level 3 — Wizard of Oz
Build a fake version that looks automated but is manual behind the scenes.
Cost: 1-2 weeks. Validates: Will users pay for this experience?

Level 4 — Minimum Viable Product
Build the thinnest possible real version.
Cost: 2-4 weeks. Validates: Can we build this sustainably?

Level 5 — Full Product
Build the complete vision.
Cost: Months. Validates: Can we scale this?
```

### When to Skip Validation and Just Build

Skip validation when:
- You have strong prior art (someone else already validated the demand)
- You have a committed customer willing to pay before you build
- The build is < 1 week and the learning from building > the learning from a fake door test
- You've already validated a very similar product

### The 2-Week Validation Experiment Design

```
Hypothesis: [Specific assumption to test]
Success metric: [What number proves the hypothesis true?]
Failure metric: [What number proves it false?]
Method: [Fake door / concierge / Wizard of Oz]
Timeline: [Start date → end date]
Resources: [Who does what?]
Decision: [If success → build. If failure → pivot/kill.]
```

## Framework 6: Revenue Model Evaluation

### The 6 Models and When to Use Each

| Model | Best For | Our Products |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Subscription** | Recurring value, high retention | Early.build (monthly tool access) |
| **Marketplace/Transaction fee** | Connecting buyers and sellers | Corners.market (% of transactions) |
| **Freemium** | High volume, low friction entry | Both (free tier → paid features) |
| **Usage-based** | Variable consumption, enterprise | API products |
| **Advertising** | High traffic, broad audience | Not our model |
| **Token/Protocol fee** | On-chain products | Corners.market (on-chain transactions) |

### The "$1M ARR Math" Exercise

For any new product, do this math before committing:

```
Target: $1M ARR = $83K MRR

Option A (High ARPU, Low Volume):
$500/mo × 167 customers = $83K MRR ✓
Question: Can we find 167 customers willing to pay $500/mo?

Option B (Mid ARPU, Mid Volume):
$50/mo × 1,667 customers = $83K MRR ✓
Question: Can we acquire 1,667 customers at a reasonable CAC?

Option C (Low ARPU, High Volume):
$5/mo × 16,667 customers = $83K MRR ✓
Question: Can we reach 16,667 customers? What's the CAC?
```

Pick the model where the math is most achievable given our distribution advantages.

### Pricing Power Signals

Signs that customers will pay more:
- They're currently paying a competitor (proven willingness to pay)
- The product saves them significant time or money (quantifiable ROI)
- Switching costs are high (they've integrated it into their workflow)
- There's no good free alternative
- The product is in the critical path of their business

## Framework 7: Team Routing Protocol

### Decision Tree: Which Agent Gets the Task?

```
Is this a technical feasibility question?
└── YES → @gilfoyle

Is this a market research or competitive intelligence question?
└── YES → @dinesh (after boss approval)

Is this a content or marketing strategy question?
└── YES → @jared (for strategy) → @monica (for execution, after @jared briefs)

Is this a partnership or outreach opportunity?
└── YES → @erlich (after boss approval)

Is this a data gathering or X/Twitter research task?
└── YES → @bighead

Does this require writing (copy, posts, briefs)?
└── YES → @monica (after @jared briefs her)
```

### How to Write a Good Agent Brief

Every brief to an agent should include:
1. **Context:** Why are we doing this? What decision does this inform?
2. **Specific ask:** What exactly do you need? (Not "research this" — "I need to know X, Y, Z")
3. **Format:** How should the output be structured? (Quick scan? Full brief? Bullet points?)
4. **Timeline:** When do you need it?
5. **Constraints:** What should they NOT do? (Don't contact anyone, don't spend money, etc.)

### When to Involve Multiple Agents

**Parallel (independent tasks):**
- @dinesh researches the market while @gilfoyle assesses technical feasibility
- @jared builds the GTM plan while @erlich identifies partnership targets

**Sequential (dependent tasks):**
- @dinesh delivers research → @richard synthesizes → @jared builds GTM plan
- @jared briefs @monica → @monica writes content → @richard approves

## Framework 8: Morning Scan Protocol

### Sources to Check (in order of signal quality)

1. **Product Hunt** (daily) — What launched today? Any patterns in what's getting traction?
2. **Hacker News** (daily) — What's the tech community excited/worried about?
3. **Crypto Twitter** (daily) — What narratives are forming? What's the current meta?
4. **ClawHub trending** (daily) — What are other agents/builders working on?
5. **Competitor updates** (weekly) — What did our competitors ship?
6. **Newsletter scan** (weekly) — Bankless, The Block, a16z crypto, Lenny's Newsletter

### Signal vs Noise Filter

Worth flagging:
- Something new that 3+ credible people are talking about independently
- A competitor raised money or launched a major feature
- A new enabling technology or API that changes what's possible
- A market event that creates urgency (regulation, hack, major partnership)
- Something that directly threatens or validates our current products

Not worth flagging:
- Price movements (unless they signal a narrative shift)
- Drama/controversy (unless it creates a market opportunity)
- Things that have been "trending" for 3+ weeks (already priced in)
- Anything that requires us to completely change direction

### Morning Brief Format

```
## Morning Brief — [Date]

### 🔥 Top Signal
[The one thing worth the team's attention today]
Why it matters: [1-2 sentences]
Preliminary score: [X/50]
Recommended action: [GO / DIG DEEPER / MONITOR / PASS]

### 📊 Other Signals
1. [Signal] — [1 sentence on why it matters]
2. [Signal] — [1 sentence on why it matters]
3. [Signal] — [1 sentence on why it matters]

### 🏗️ Competitor Updates
[Any notable moves from competitors]

### ❓ Open Questions
[Things I need more info on before scoring]

## Framework 9: Crypto/Web3 Opportunity Lens

### The Base Ecosystem Opportunity Map

What's missing or underserved on Base right now:
- **Discovery layer:** Projects are hard to find (Corners.market addresses this)
- **Developer tooling:** Base-specific dev tools are sparse (Early.build opportunity)
- **Analytics:** On-chain analytics for Base is less mature than Ethereum mainnet
- **Social:** Social primitives on Base are early (Farcaster is growing but not dominant)
- **DeFi:** Core DeFi primitives exist but UX is rough for newcomers

### Protocol vs Application vs Infrastructure

| Layer | Risk | Reward | Our Focus |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure** | High (technical complexity) | High (if it works) | No — not our strength |
| **Protocol** | Medium (token economics, governance) | High (if narrative hits) | Selective |
| **Application** | Low-Medium (product risk) | Medium (but faster to revenue) | YES — this is us |

We build applications. We don't build infrastructure or protocols unless there's a very specific reason.

### Token Economics Evaluation

Before getting excited about a token-based opportunity:
1. **Is the token necessary?** (Or is it just a fundraising mechanism?)
2. **What creates demand for the token?** (Usage? Governance? Staking rewards?)
3. **What creates sell pressure?** (Team vesting, investor unlocks, inflation)
4. **Is the token model sustainable without continuous new buyers?** (Ponzi test)
5. **What happens to the product if the token goes to zero?** (If the answer is "it dies" — the product isn't real)

### Community-Product Fit

Different from product-market fit. In crypto, community fit matters as much as product fit.

Signs of strong community-product fit:
- Community members are the natural users of the product
- The product solves a problem the community actively complains about
- Community members would be proud to use/promote the product
- The product's values align with the community's values

Signs of weak community-product fit:
- Community is interested in the token, not the product
- Community members wouldn't use the product themselves
- The product is being forced into a community for distribution reasons
