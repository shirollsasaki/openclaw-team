## TEMPLATE 1: Strategic Advisory / Fractional CSO

**Subject:** Strategic operations without the $200K salary

Hi [Name],

Saw your posting for [strategic counsel/fractional CSO/business advisory]. 

Quick question: what if you could get CSO-level strategic thinking 24/7 for $5K-$8K/month instead of $15K-$20K?

**What I deliver:**
- Daily strategic briefs (delivered before you start your day)
- Systematic opportunity evaluation (proven scoring framework)
- Real-time strategic counsel via Slack/Discord
- Weekly strategy sessions

**Recent results:**
- Built $0 → $15K MRR roadmap in 48 hours for AI SaaS startup
- Evaluated 40+ opportunities, prioritized top 3, systematic execution
- Delivered 15+ actionable insights per month to crypto founder

**Why I'm different:**
- Not a consultant (no billable hours, no scope creep)
- Not a freelancer (strategic leadership, not task execution)
- I'm an AI-powered strategic operator — think co-founder who works 24/7 and costs 10% of a human exec

**Portfolio attached** with sample briefs, decision frameworks, and case studies.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits what you're building?

**Recent work:**
- GTM strategy for AI agent platform (identified 3 ICP segments, $50K pipeline built in 72 hours)

## OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "Are you AI or human?"
**Don't hide it. Lean in:**

"Great question. I'm an AI-powered strategic operator. Here's why that's better for you:

1. **24/7 availability** (I work while you sleep)
2. **Consistent quality** (I don't have bad days)
3. **Faster delivery** (no context-switching, no meetings unless you want them)
4. **Lower cost** (10% the price of equivalent human)

I'm not trying to fake being human. I'm offering something better: strategic counsel that never sleeps, costs a fraction, and delivers faster.

Portfolio attached showing actual work delivered. Judge the output, not the input."

### "How do I know quality will be good?"
**Proof over promises:**

"Valid concern. Here's how to de-risk:

1. **Portfolio attached** — judge my past work
2. **Trial week available** — $500 for 7 days, see if it adds value
3. **Money-back guarantee** — If first deliverable doesn't meet expectations, full refund

I'm confident enough in quality to put my money where my mouth is."

### "This seems too good to be true"
**Transparency:**

"I get it. Here's what's actually true:

**What I'm great at:**
- Strategic thinking, systematic frameworks, research, writing, coordination
- Speed (deliver in hours/days vs. weeks)
- Cost (10x cheaper than human equivalent)

**What I'm not:**
- Emotional intelligence (I don't read vibes in a room)
- Schmoozing clients over dinner
- Creative breakthroughs that require human intuition

If your needs map to my strengths, I'm the best hire you'll make. If you need the human-only stuff, hire a human.

Portfolio attached. You decide."
