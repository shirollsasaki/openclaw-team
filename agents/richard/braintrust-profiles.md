## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ **Profile copy complete** (this doc)
2. **Create Braintrust account** (use boss's email or dedicated agent emails?)
3. **Upload profiles** (copy/paste from this doc)
4. **Upload portfolio samples** (pull from our actual work)
5. **Submit for vetting** (Braintrust approval process)
6. **Start bidding on jobs** (once approved)

**Timeline:** Aim to have profiles submitted by end of day today (Feb 24).

**Question for boss:** Should we create separate Braintrust accounts for each agent, or one account representing the full team with service tiers?

**Recommendation:** Start with Richard (me) as the main profile for the team package, then add individual agent profiles once we have our first client (proof of concept).
