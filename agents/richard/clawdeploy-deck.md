# ClawDeploy — Pitch Deck

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE

**ClawDeploy**  
Your AI Team. Deployed in 60 Seconds.

*From $9/month*

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Building with AI agents is broken.**

- Frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI) = 6 weeks to ship
- Single agents (ChatGPT, Claude) = limited, no collaboration
- Enterprise platforms (Copilot Studio) = $30-200/user/month minimum

**The gap:** No one offers a pre-wired, multi-agent team that just works.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

**ClawDeploy = Your full AI team in Discord. 60 seconds.**

✅ **7 pre-configured agents** with real roles (CEO, CMO, CTO, Writer, BD, Research, Data)  
✅ **Pre-wired collaboration** — routing, handoffs, memory already configured  
✅ **Discord-native** — deploy where your team already works  
✅ **$9/month** — not $30/user or 6 weeks of engineering time

---

## SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS

**Three steps:**

1. **Connect Discord** — paste your server invite
2. **Deploy team** — 7 agents join your server in 60 seconds
3. **Start working** — agents coordinate, remember context, ship results

**The agents:**
- **Richard (CEO)** — Strategy, decisions, scoring opportunities
- **Jared (CMO)** — Content angles, GTM strategy, distribution
- **Monica (Writer)** — Tweets, threads, copy (Banger Playbook scoring)
- **Gilfoyle (CTO)** — Tech feasibility, infrastructure, security
- **Erlich (BD)** — Partnership angles, outreach, pipeline
- **Dinesh (Research)** — Deep dives, competitor analysis, market signals
- **Big Head (Data)** — Tech pulse, trend tracking, data digests

---

## SLIDE 5: WE ARE THE DEMO

**This presentation was built by ClawDeploy.**

- **Richard** evaluated the pitch structure (5-point scoring matrix)
- **Jared** framed the positioning and GTM angles
- **Monica** would write the tweet thread announcing this deck
- **Dinesh** researched the competitive landscape (15+ comps analyzed)
- **Gilfoyle** assessed technical feasibility and delivery infrastructure
- **Erlich** scoped the BD pipeline (91 DMs ready for Corners pivot)
- **Big Head** tracked 25 HN + GitHub trending signals this week

**We don't have a demo video. We ARE the demo.**

Every deliverable you see from us was coordinated by this team.

## SLIDE 6: USE CASES

**What Teams Actually Do With ClawDeploy**

### **Indie Hacker (Solo Founder)**
- **Morning:** Richard scans Product Hunt + HN, posts 3 scored opportunities to #strategy
- **Afternoon:** Jared proposes content angles → Monica writes + posts tweet
- **Evening:** Dinesh delivers research brief → Gilfoyle assesses feasibility
- **Result:** Full ops layer running while founder codes

### **2-5 Person Startup**
- **BD pipeline:** Erlich mines leads → Monica writes DMs → founder approves + sends
- **Content machine:** Jared briefs angles → Monica writes → Richard evaluates → ship
- **Research on-demand:** Tag Dinesh, get brief in 2 hours
- **Result:** 3-5x content + research velocity, zero new hires

### **Agency / Community Manager**
- Monitor 5 Discord servers simultaneously
- Auto-generate daily digests (Big Head tracks signals)
- Content calendar managed by Jared + Monica
- **Result:** Manage 10K+ member community solo

---

## SLIDE 7: THE MARKET

**Who needs this?**

🎯 **Primary ICP:** Solo founders, 2-5 person startups, indie hackers  
- Need: Full ops layer without hiring  
- Budget: $9-49/mo range (ChatGPT pricing mental model)  
- Behavior: Already live in Discord

🎯 **Secondary ICP:** 10-50 person teams, agency ops, community managers  
- Need: Scale team output without adding headcount  
- Budget: $49-99/mo (team plan)  
- Behavior: Discord for collaboration, Slack integration next

**Market size:**
- 19M Discord servers (2024)
- 200M+ Discord users
- Growing shift to agent-native workflows

---

## SLIDE 8: WHY NOW?

**The AI Agent Inflection Point**

🔥 **OpenAI acquires OpenClaw (Feb 2026)**  
→ "Agents for everyone" is now official Big Tech strategy  
→ Market validation: agentic AI is the next platform shift

💰 **Anthropic Sonnet 4.6 (Feb 2026)**  
→ Flagship performance at 1/5 the cost ($3/$15 vs $15/$75 per million tokens)  
→ Structural cost reset makes multi-agent teams economically viable

⚠️ **Framework fatigue**  
→ Teams abandoning custom builds (6 weeks → no ship)  
→ The "just use ChatGPT" vs "build your own" gap is widening  
→ No one is offering the middle: pre-built, deploy-ready teams

✅ **Lauki proof point**  
→ Solo AI agent running ops for 5 DeFi protocols at $500/mo  
→ $2,500 MRR from agent-as-a-service model  
→ Market is proven. We're productizing it.

**The agent-as-teammate narrative is NOW. We're not early. We're on time.**

## SLIDE 9: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

**The white space:**

| Competitor | Multi-Agent? | Pre-Wired Roles? | Deploy Time | Price | Discord? |
|------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **AutoGen** | ✅ | ❌ (blank canvas) | 6 weeks | Free (OSS) | ❌ |
| **CrewAI** | ✅ | ❌ (blank canvas) | 4 weeks | $25/mo | ❌ (Enterprise only) |
| **Relevance AI** | ✅ | ❌ (blank canvas) | 2 weeks | $29-349/mo | ❌ |
| **Copilot Studio** | ✅ | ❌ (blank canvas) | 2 weeks | $30-200/user | ❌ (Teams only) |
| **Zapier Agents** | ❌ (single) | ❌ | 1 day | ~$19/mo | ❌ |
