## RICHARD — Strategic Operations

### Sample 1: Opportunity Evaluation Framework

**Client need:** "How do we evaluate which ideas to pursue?"

**Deliverable:** 5-Dimension Scoring Matrix

```markdown
## Opportunity Scoring Matrix

Every idea gets scored 1-10 on these dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Revenue Potential** | How fast can this generate real money? |
| **Build Complexity** | Can we ship MVP in <2 weeks? |
| **Distribution Advantage** | Do we have an unfair channel? |
| **Timing** | Is this trending NOW? |
| **Moat** | What stops clones? |

**Scoring:**
- 40-50: Strong GO
- 30-39: DIG DEEPER
- 20-29: Risky, park it
- <20: Kill it

**Example evaluation:**

- Complexity: 7/10 (profiles done in 1 day, execution ongoing)
- Distribution: 7/10 (platforms have built-in traffic)

## Deal Strategy: [Prospect Name]

**Context:** Inbound from Discord ops lead, 50K member community, currently spending $3K/month on 2 part-time moderators

3. "How do we onboard our community to AI moderation?"

**How to handle:**
1. Transparency play: "Yes, it's AI. Here's the demo running live in our Discord. Watch it work."
2. Safety net: "30-day trial. If it breaks, we fix it or you don't pay."
3. Gradual rollout: "Start with 3 agents (content, research, data), add more as trust builds."

**Pricing strategy:**
- Ask: $5K setup + $500/month
- Walk-away: $3K setup + $500/month
- Upsell angle: White-label ($500 extra/month) if they want to resell to their community

**Next steps:**
1. Send demo video (not pitch deck)
2. Offer 15-min live walkthrough
3. If yes → Trial starts this week
```

**Result:** Deal closed at $4K setup + $500/month, upsold white-label Week 2 (+$500/mo).

## DINESH — Research & Intelligence

### Sample 1: Competitive Analysis

**Client need:** "Who else is doing AI agent ops? Are we too late?"

**Deliverable:** Competitive landscape report

```markdown
## Competitive Analysis: AI Agent Operations

**Direct competitors:**

**@laukiantonson (Closest comp)**
- Service: Full-stack ops for DeFi protocols
- Pricing: $500/month per client
- Traction: 5 clients ($2.5K MRR)
- Strengths: Strong social proof, crypto-native positioning
- Weaknesses: Solo agent (not team), DeFi-only
- **Gap we exploit:** Multi-agent coordination, broader ICP

**[6 more competitors analyzed...]**

**Market gaps identified:**
1. No one offering "team in a box" (all solo agents)
2. Enterprise Discord ops underserved
3. Pricing mostly <$1K/month (room for premium)

**Recommendations:**
- Position as premium (team vs. solo)
- Target enterprise ($5K+ budgets)
- Emphasize coordination (our moat)
```

**Result:** Client pivots positioning, avoids commoditized low-price segment, targets $15K/month vs. $2K/month.

**Client need:** "What's happening in AI/crypto/SaaS that I should know about?"

**Deliverable:** Morning research brief (delivered before client wakes up)

## Research Digest — [Date]

**HIGH SIGNAL: Anthropic Claude COBOL Automation**
- What: Anthropic announced AI agent for legacy COBOL systems
- Why it matters: $400B+ COBOL infrastructure, aging developers, massive TAM
- Stock impact: IBM -11% (Wall Street fears disruption)
- Opportunity angle: Could similar "legacy system automation" work for other verticals?
- Recommended action: DIG DEEPER — research legacy system pain points in finance/healthcare

**[2 more signals...]**

## GILFOYLE — Technical Strategy

### Sample 1: Architecture Review

**Client need:** "Can our platform handle 100 clients?"

**Deliverable:** Scalability assessment

```markdown
## Scalability Assessment — Multi-Client Deployment

**Current architecture:**
- Single OpenClaw instance
- Agent sessions per client
- Shared API quotas

**Bottlenecks identified:**
1. **API rate limits** — Claude API: 10K RPM (breaks at ~40 clients)
2. **Memory constraints** — Session context grows linearly with clients
3. **Delivery routing** — Discord bot rate limits at 50 servers

**Recommendations:**

**Short-term (0-20 clients):**
- ✅ No changes needed
- Monitor: API usage, session memory, delivery latency

**Medium-term (20-50 clients):**
- Implement: API quota sharding across multiple keys
- Optimize: Session context pruning (keep last 50 messages, not full history)
- Cost: $200/month additional API keys

**Long-term (50+ clients):**
- Migrate: Multi-tenant architecture (isolated instances per client)
- Invest: Custom message queue for delivery routing
- Cost: $2K/month infrastructure + 2 weeks engineering time

**Verdict:** ✅ Can launch today, scale path clear, bottlenecks addressable
```

**Result:** Client launches immediately (vs. waiting 3 months to "build it right"), revenue validates need, scales infrastructure only when required.

---

### Sample 2: Technical Feasibility Check

**Client need:** "Can we white-label this for enterprise clients?"

**Deliverable:** Feasibility assessment + implementation plan

```markdown
## White-Label Feasibility

**Can we do it?** ✅ Yes

**What's required:**
1. Custom branding per client (agent names, avatars, tone)
2. Isolated Discord bots (separate apps per client)
3. Client-specific knowledge base (no cross-contamination)

**Implementation:**
- Week 1: Build client config system (YAML per client)
- Week 2: Deploy isolated bot instances
- Week 3: Test + QA

**Cost to deliver:** 3 weeks engineering time  
**Pricing recommendation:** +$500/month white-label fee (covers infrastructure + support)

**Risk assessment:**
- Low: Technical complexity (standard OAuth + config management)
- Medium: Support overhead (more clients = more unique configs)
- Mitigation: Templatize common configs, charge premium for custom

**Verdict:** ✅ GO — White-label adds $500/month per client, differentiates from competitors, justified 3-week build time
```

**Result:** Client adds white-label tier, first enterprise client pays $25K/year (vs. $15K for standard tier), feature validated before building.

## BIG HEAD — Data & Analytics

### Sample 1: Competitor Monitoring Dashboard

**Client need:** "How do we track what competitors are doing?"

- Hiring signals (LinkedIn job posts)

**Alert triggers:**
- Competitor launches new feature → Slack alert within 1 hour
- Pricing change detected → Immediate notification

**Sample alert:**
"🚨 @competitor just announced Enterprise tier at $20K/month (vs. our $25K).

Positioning: White-label + dedicated support.
Our response options: [...]"
```

**Result:** Client stays ahead of market moves, adjusts pricing 2 days before competitor undercut, maintains premium positioning.

**Client need:** "Which Twitter accounts should we engage with?"

**Deliverable:** Influencer tracking + engagement recommendations
