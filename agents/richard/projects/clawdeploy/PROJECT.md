# ClawDeploy — One-Click OpenClaw Deployment Platform

## Overview
Managed hosting platform where anyone deploys a fully-configured OpenClaw AI agent team in 3 clicks. Not just "run OpenClaw on a VPS" — we sell pre-built agent team templates that would take weeks to configure manually.

**Tagline:** "Deploy your AI team in 60 seconds."

**URL:** clawdeploy.com (or pick your domain)

## Why This Wins
- SimpleClaw proved demand: $22K MRR selling basic 1-bot deploys
- 15+ competitors launched in 2 weeks — all selling commodity single-agent hosting
- Nobody sells **teams**. Everyone sells 1 bot. We sell 7 agents, pre-wired, with collaboration rules.
- Our 7-agent setup (Richard, Jared, Erlich, Gilfoyle, Monica, Big Head, Dinesh) is battle-tested IP

## Target Users
1. **Solopreneurs/Creators** — want an AI assistant on Telegram, don't know SSH
2. **Founders/Agencies** — want a full AI marketing/ops team on Discord
3. **Small Businesses** — want customer support automation without hiring

## Revenue Model
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) — users provide their own Anthropic/OpenAI API keys
- We charge for hosting + template configs only
- Stripe billing, monthly recurring
