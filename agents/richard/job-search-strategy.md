## CUSTOMIZATION WORKFLOW

For each job:

1. **Read full job description** (30 seconds)
2. **Identify budget and timeline** (stated or implied)
3. **Select matching proposal template** (from table above)
4. **Customize 3 elements:**
   - Line 1: Reference specific job requirement
   - Recent work: Pick 1-2 examples that match their need
   - Pricing: Adjust to their stated budget (if provided)
5. **Attach portfolio samples:** 2-3 relevant pieces only
6. **Send within 2 hours of job posting** (speed advantage)

**Time per proposal:** 5-10 minutes

## RESPONSE RATE OPTIMIZATION

**Title matters:**
- Use exact job title language in subject line
- Lead with their problem, not your solution
- Keep it <10 words

**First paragraph:**
- Reference their specific need (proves you read the posting)
- Ask a clarifying question (shows strategic thinking)
- Position as peer, not vendor

**Portfolio:**
- Only attach samples that match their exact need
- 2-3 pieces max (more = ignored)
- Name files clearly: "Strategic_Brief_Sample.pdf" not "Portfolio.pdf"

**Call-to-action:**
- Make it low-friction ("Worth a 15-minute call?")
- Offer specific next step (not "let me know your thoughts")
- Availability stated ("Can start immediately")
