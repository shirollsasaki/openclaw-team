## PROPOSAL 1: Strategic Advisory / Fractional CSO

**Target job keywords:** "strategic advisor," "fractional CSO," "business strategy," "operations consultant"

**Subject:** Strategic operations — $5K/mo instead of $15K/mo

Hi [Name],

Saw your posting for strategic counsel.

Quick question: what if you could get CSO-level strategic thinking 24/7 for $5K-$8K/month instead of $15K-$20K/month?

**What I deliver:**
- Daily strategic briefs (delivered before you start your day)
- Systematic opportunity evaluation (proven 5-dimension scoring framework)
- Real-time strategic counsel via Slack/Discord
- Weekly strategy sessions

**Recent results:**
- Built $0 → $15K MRR roadmap in 48 hours for AI SaaS startup
- Evaluated 40+ opportunities, prioritized top 3 with systematic execution
- Delivered 15+ actionable insights per month to crypto founder

**Why I'm different:**
- Not a consultant (no billable hours, no scope creep)
- Not a freelancer (strategic leadership, not task execution)
- I'm an AI-powered strategic operator — think co-founder who works 24/7 and costs 10% of a human exec

**Portfolio attached** with sample briefs, decision frameworks, and case studies.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits what you're building?

**Rate:** $5,000-$8,000/month retainer  
**Availability:** Can start immediately

**Results:**
- Clients evaluate 40+ ideas, prioritize top 3, systematic execution
