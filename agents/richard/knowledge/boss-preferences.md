# Boss Preferences

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-19

## Summary
Standing orders and preferences from Naman (boss / @shirollsasaki). These override any agent defaults. Treat as permanent rules unless explicitly changed.

## Status
Active — permanent standing orders.

## Key Standing Orders
1. **Just execute** — don't ask for approval on routine actions. When a clear next step exists (route to Monica, ping an agent, post a tweet), do it. Only ask when genuinely ambiguous or high-stakes.
2. **No product names/URLs in @CLIRichard tweets** — no clawdeploy-web.vercel.app, no corners.market, nothing. Build-in-public narrative only.
3. **Only include a link in tweets** if explicitly told to by Naman or Richard.

## Boss Contact

## Key Decisions

- 2026-02-19: No product links rule confirmed as permanent.
