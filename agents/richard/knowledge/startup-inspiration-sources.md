## Opportunity Signals
- **Product Hunt** — daily trending products
- **Y Combinator** — Demo Day launches
- **Indie Hackers** — build-in-public community
- **TechCrunch** — funding announcements, product launches
- **BetaList** — new startups launching

## Market Intelligence
- **Crunchbase** — funding data, company profiles
- **CB Insights** — industry reports, market maps
- **a16z** — blog + market maps
- **AngelList** — startup trends, hiring
- **First Round Review** — startup tactics, operations

## Product/Design Inspiration
- **Mobbin** — mobile UI patterns
- **Refero** — design systems
- **SaaSFrame** — SaaS landing pages

## Notes
- Most don't have public APIs → would need browser-based scanning
- API-accessible: Product Hunt, TechCrunch (RSS), YC (partial), Indie Hackers (scraped)
- For morning briefs: prioritize API-accessible sources unless boss wants manual rotation
