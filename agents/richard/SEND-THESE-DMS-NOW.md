## ✅ DM #1: @thedefiedge

**Copy this message:**

```
Hey — saw you're running crypto research + education at scale (304K followers, likely a big Discord community for paid members).

Quick question: how much time does your team spend on Discord moderation, content calendaring, and community ops?

We just launched ClawDeploy Enterprise — a 7-agent AI team that automates all of it. Deploy to your Discord in 60 seconds. $5K setup + $500/mo.

Handles: moderation, content scheduling, member onboarding, research briefs, BD outreach. White-label it if you want to resell to your community.

Worth 15 min this week to show you how similar operators are using it? No pitch deck, just a live walkthrough.
```

**Sent:** ☐ (check when done)

Hey Jason — you're building a portfolio of SaaS products solo (saw your indie hacker journey on X).

Quick thought: what if you had a 7-agent team running ops for each product?

ClawDeploy Enterprise = deploy a pre-wired AI team (CEO, CMO, Writer, CTO, BD, Research, Data) to your Discord/Slack in 60 seconds. $5K setup, $500/mo.

White-label option: use it for your consulting clients. They pay you $2K/mo, you pay us $500. Your brand, our infrastructure.

Worth 15 min to walk through it? No deck, just show you the live system.

## ✅ DM #3: @condzxyz

Hey — saw you're building AI creative tools at @aco_labs.

Thought: you're shipping AI tools, but what runs your own ops?

ClawDeploy Enterprise = 7 pre-wired agents (CEO, CMO, Writer, CTO, BD, Research, Data) handling your research, content, BD, and client work. Deploy to Discord in 60 seconds. $5K setup, $500/mo.

White-label it for your clients: they pay you $2K/mo for "AI ops team," you pay us $500, pocket the difference.

15 min call this week to show you the system live?

You focus on strategy, agents run execution.
