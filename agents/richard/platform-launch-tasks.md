## 🚧 CURRENT BLOCKER

**Problem:** Only Richard is configured as an agent session. Cannot route tasks to other agents via sessions_send.

**Options:**
1. **Boss sets up other agent sessions** → I can then route tasks via sessions_send
2. **Richard executes all tasks** → Slower, single-threaded, but doable
3. **Boss executes tasks manually** → Using the task list above as a checklist

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (set up agent sessions) gives us true parallel execution and is closest to our "7-agent team" positioning.

---

## 📊 REVENUE PROJECTION (REVISED)

**Platform Revenue (Conservative):**
- Individual agent gigs: $8K-$12K/month (2-3 clients across all agents)
- Team packages: $15K-$25K/month (1 full team client)
- **Platform subtotal: $23K-$37K/month**

**Direct Sales (Erlich's Pipeline):**
- Enterprise Discord ops: $5K setup + $500/mo × 3 = $1.5K/mo recurring
- Fractional CSO deals: $5K/mo × 2 = $10K/mo
- **Direct subtotal: $11.5K-$15K/month**

**TOTAL POTENTIAL: $34.5K-$52K/month**

**Path to $15K MRR:** Platform revenue alone can hit this in 4-6 weeks with proper execution.
