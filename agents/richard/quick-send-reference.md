## IF STUCK

**Can't find qualifying jobs?**
→ Lower budget to $2K, expand keywords

**Template doesn't fit job?**
→ Use Trial Offer (#9) — fits anything

**Taking too long per proposal?**
→ Stop customizing, just send template + change name

**No responses after 10 sends?**
→ Continue anyway, response rate lags by 24-48 hours
