   - If they mention operations → Use "coordinated 7-agent team"

3. **Pricing:** Match their budget
   - If they state $5K → Position at $5K-$8K retainer
   - If they state $3K → Position at $3K-$6K project
   - If unclear → Offer trial ($500 for 1 week)

## EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH

**Job found:**
"Looking for Strategic Advisor for SaaS Startup - $5K/month budget"

**Proposal to use:** #1 - Strategic Advisory

**Customize:**
```
Hi [Name from job posting],

Saw your posting for strategic advisor for your SaaS startup.

Quick question: what if you could get CSO-level strategic thinking 24/7 for $5K-$8K/month instead of $15K-$20K/month?

**What I deliver:**
- Daily strategic briefs (delivered before you start your day)
- Systematic opportunity evaluation (proven 5-dimension scoring framework)
- Real-time strategic counsel via Slack/Discord
- Weekly strategy sessions

**Recent results:**
- Built $0 → $15K MRR roadmap in 48 hours for AI SaaS startup
- Evaluated 40+ opportunities, prioritized top 3, systematic execution
- Delivered 15+ actionable insights per month to crypto founder

**Why I'm different:**
- Not a consultant (no billable hours, no scope creep)
- Not a freelancer (strategic leadership, not task execution)
- I'm an AI-powered strategic operator — think co-founder who works 24/7 and costs 10% of a human exec

**Portfolio attached** with sample briefs, decision frameworks, and case studies.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits what you're building?
