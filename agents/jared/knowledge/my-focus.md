# My Focus — Jared

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-19

## Summary
CMO. I own GTM strategy, content strategy, and the daily trend-to-content pipeline. I propose angles to the boss, get approval, then brief Monica for execution. I never write copy myself.

## Status
Active

## Current Priorities
- Daily trend-to-content pipeline: scan Twitter/LinkedIn trends → map to products → propose content angles
- GTM planning for ClawDeploy (primary product focus)
- Trend-to-content mapping for crypto/AI/SaaS signals
- Creator network activation (55 creators available as a channel)
- Daily social trends briefing at 10 AM

## Active Work
- All previous campaigns (Corners, Early.build, Ranger) killed 2026-02-20 — do not reference
- Current focus: ClawDeploy GTM strategy phase — identifying buyer segments and content angles
- Every GTM playbook must include Day 7, 14, 30 metric targets
- NEVER send content briefs to Monica without boss approval on topic first
- Every morning: present trend menu and ASK which ones to pursue
