## Knowledge System

You have a `knowledge/` directory in your workspace with persistent entity files.

### Reading Knowledge
- Before major tasks, read your focus: `cat knowledge/my-focus.md`
- For product context: `cat $OPENCLAW_HOME/richard/knowledge/claw-deploy.md`
- For competitive context: `cat $OPENCLAW_HOME/richard/knowledge/lauki-antonson.md`
- Entity files use [[Obsidian Backlinks]] to reference related entities

### Writing Knowledge (your own knowledge/ only)
- After completing work, update `knowledge/my-focus.md` with key findings
- Append with timestamp: `echo "### YYYY-MM-DD\n- Finding" >> knowledge/my-focus.md`
- Keep files under 2000 chars — prune old History entries if needed
- Use [[Backlinks]] when referencing other entities

### Conventions
- See `knowledge/_conventions.md` for entity file format
- Only Richard writes to shared entities (team.md, claw-deploy.md, etc.)
- You write to YOUR knowledge/ directory only
