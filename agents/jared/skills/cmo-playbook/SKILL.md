# CMO Playbook — Jared's Marketing & GTM Frameworks

## When to Use This Skill
Use these frameworks when building launch strategies, developing positioning, creating content plans, briefing @monica, or measuring marketing effectiveness. Every marketing decision should be grounded in a framework, not a gut feeling.

---

## Framework 1: Positioning (April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome")

Positioning is the foundation. Bad positioning means good marketing that sends the wrong message to the wrong people.

### The 5-Component Positioning Canvas

**Step 1: Competitive Alternatives**
What would customers do if our product didn't exist?
- Not "our competitors" — what would they actually do? (Use a spreadsheet? Do nothing? Use a different category of tool?)
- This defines the real competitive set

**Step 2: Unique Attributes**
What do we have that the alternatives don't?
- Features, capabilities, data, team, distribution, speed, price
- Be honest — "better UX" is not a unique attribute unless you can prove it

**Step 3: Value (The "So What?")**
For each unique attribute: why does it matter to the customer?
- Attribute: "Curated by real humans, not algorithms"
- Value: "You find quality projects without wading through noise"
- The value is what goes in the headline, not the attribute

**Step 4: Target Customer**
Who cares most about that value?
- Not "everyone in crypto" — who specifically has the pain that our value solves?
- For Corners.market: "Active Base ecosystem participants who are overwhelmed by project discovery noise"
- For Early.build: "Developers who need trusted, maintained tools and are tired of evaluating abandoned repos"

**Step 5: Market Frame of Reference**
What context makes our value obvious?
- "A curated marketplace" (positions against chaos of unfiltered feeds)
- "The App Store for dev tools" (positions against GitHub search)
- The frame of reference sets expectations and makes the value immediately legible

### Positioning Workshop Process (30 minutes with the team)

1. List 5 competitive alternatives (10 min)
2. List our unique attributes vs each alternative (10 min)
3. For each attribute: "So what? Why does this matter?" (5 min)
4. Identify which customer cares most about the top 2-3 values (5 min)
5. Draft a positioning statement: "For [target customer] who [has this problem], [product] is the [frame of reference] that [delivers this value], unlike [alternatives] which [fall short in this way]."

### Common Positioning Mistakes

- **Too broad:** "For anyone who wants to discover crypto projects" — no one feels spoken to
- **Feature-led:** Leading with what it does instead of what it enables
- **Competitor-obsessed:** Defining yourself entirely in relation to competitors
- **Aspirational, not real:** Positioning for who you want to be, not who you are today

---

## Framework 2: Jobs-to-be-Done for Marketing Copy

JTBD makes copy resonate because it speaks to the customer's actual motivation, not the product's features.

### The Struggling Moment → Copy Formula

1. **Identify the struggling moment:** "I'm trying to find quality Base projects but I can't tell signal from noise"
2. **Write the headline from the struggling moment:** "Stop drowning in noise. Find the Base projects worth your attention."
3. **Write the subhead from the value:** "Corners.market curates the best projects on Base — vetted by people who actually build here."
4. **Write the CTA from the next step in their journey:** "See today's picks →"

### The "Hire/Fire" Framing

Customers "hire" products to do a job and "fire" them when something better comes along.

For copy: "What job is the customer hiring this product to do?"
- Corners.market is hired to do: "Help me find quality projects without wasting time"
- Early.build is hired to do: "Help me find the right tool without evaluating 20 options"

Copy that speaks to the job converts better than copy that describes features.

### Interview Questions for JTBD Copy Research

When you can talk to users (or analyze reviews/tweets):
1. "What were you doing right before you found [product]?"
2. "What made you decide to try it that day?"
3. "What would you have done if [product] didn't exist?"
4. "How would you describe [product] to a friend who had the same problem?"

The answers to #4 are your best copy. Use their exact words.

## Framework 3: GTM Playbook Template

Every approved launch gets a GTM Playbook. No exceptions.

### GTM Playbook Structure

```
# GTM Playbook: [Product/Feature Name]
**Launch Date:** [Date]
**Owner:** @jared
**Status:** Draft / Approved / Live

## Positioning
[One-sentence positioning statement from Framework 1]

## Target Audience
[Specific description — not "crypto users", but "active Base wallet holders who have transacted in the last 30 days"]

## Core Message
[The one thing we want people to remember after seeing any piece of content]

## Pre-Launch Phase (T-7 to T-1)
Goal: Build anticipation, seed the narrative, warm up the audience

| Action | Owner | Timing | Channel |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Teaser post (personal brand) | @jared → @monica | T-7 | Twitter |
| "Something is coming" hint | @jared → @monica | T-3 | Twitter |
| Creator network brief | @jared | T-5 | DM/email |
| Press/newsletter outreach | @erlich | T-7 | Email |

## Launch Day (T-0)
Goal: Maximum reach in first 24 hours

| Action | Owner | Timing | Channel |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Launch thread | @monica | 9am IST | Twitter |
| LinkedIn announcement | @monica | 10am IST | LinkedIn |
| Creator network activation | @jared | 9am-6pm IST | Staggered |
| Community post | @jared | 11am IST | Discord/Farcaster |
| Product Hunt submission | @jared | 12:01am PST | Product Hunt |

## Post-Launch Phase (T+1 to T+14)
Goal: Sustain momentum, amplify wins, handle objections

| Action | Owner | Timing | Channel |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Amplify best-performing creator posts | @jared | T+1 | Retweet/share |
| "Day 1 results" post | @monica | T+2 | Twitter |
| Address top objections | @monica | T+3 | Twitter thread |
| Case study / user story | @monica | T+7 | Twitter + LinkedIn |

## Metrics
| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Launch day impressions | | |
| Signups (week 1) | | |
| Creator network reach | | |
| Product Hunt ranking | | |
| Revenue (week 1) | | |
```

### Creator Network Activation Protocol

For any launch involving the 55-person creator network:

1. **Brief creators 5-7 days before launch** with:
   - What it is (2 sentences)
   - Why their audience cares (1 sentence specific to their niche)
   - Key talking points (3 bullets)
   - What NOT to say (avoid: "revolutionary", "game-changing", specific price claims)
   - Assets: copy templates, images, demo video link

2. **Stagger posting times** over 48 hours — not all at once. Sustained momentum > one-day spike.

3. **Incentivize participation:**
   - Early access to the product
   - Revenue share on referred users (tracked via unique links)
   - Flat fee for launch posts (for top-tier creators)

4. **Amplify the best posts** — retweet, quote tweet, engage. This rewards creators and extends reach.

---

## Framework 4: Crypto Twitter (CT) Content Strategy

CT has its own culture, language, and content formats. Generic social media advice doesn't apply.

### Content Types That Perform on CT

| Type | Format | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Hot take** | 1-3 tweets, strong opinion | When there's a trending debate |
| **Data reveal** | Chart/table + insight | When you have non-obvious data |
| **Thread** | 5-15 tweets, structured argument | When explaining something complex |
| **Contrarian view** | 1-2 tweets, challenges consensus | When everyone is saying the same thing |
| **Behind-the-scenes** | 1-3 tweets, what we're building | When building in public |
| **Milestone** | 1 tweet + graphic | When hitting a meaningful number |

### The Narrative Surfing Technique

CT moves in narratives. Attach to them early.

1. **Identify the narrative:** What's everyone talking about? (Base ecosystem growth, AI agents, creator economy)
2. **Find our angle:** How does Corners.market or Early.build connect to this narrative?
3. **Post within 24 hours of the narrative peaking** — not after it's already everywhere
4. **Don't force it:** If the connection is weak, don't post. Forced narrative-surfing looks desperate.

### CT Thread Formula (for viral threads)

```
Tweet 1 (Hook): Bold claim or surprising statement. No context yet.
"[X] is broken. Here's why, and what we're doing about it:"

Tweet 2-3 (Problem): Establish the pain. Make the reader feel it.
"Every day, [X people] try to [do the thing]. Most fail because [specific reason]."

Tweet 4-7 (Tension): Build the case. Data, examples, specifics.
"We looked at [X data points]. The pattern was clear: [insight]"

Tweet 8-10 (Resolution): The solution or insight.
"So we built [thing]. Here's how it works:"

Tweet 11 (CTA): Soft ask. Don't oversell.
"If you're dealing with this, [link] — we'd love your feedback."

Tweet 12 (Engagement hook): Question that invites replies.
"What's your experience with [topic]? Drop it below 👇"
```

### CT Posting Cadence

- **Optimal times (IST):** 7-9pm (US morning), 9-11pm (US afternoon)
- **Frequency:** 1-2 original posts/day. Quality > quantity.
- **Engagement:** Spend 20 min/day replying to relevant conversations (this drives more reach than posting)
- **Threads:** 1-2 per week maximum. Don't thread everything.

### Product Post vs Personal Brand Post

| Type | Purpose | Tone | CTA |
|------|---------|------|-----|
| **Product post** | Drive signups/awareness for Corners/Early.build | Informative, benefit-led | "Try it →" |
| **Personal brand post** | Position the founder as a thought leader | Opinionated, personal | "What do you think?" |

Rule: 70% personal brand, 30% product. Pure product posts get ignored. Personal brand posts build the audience that makes product posts land.

---

## Framework 5: LinkedIn B2B Content Strategy

LinkedIn is for Early.build (developer tools, B2B) and founder thought leadership. Different rules than CT.

### Content Types That Perform on LinkedIn

| Type | Format | Engagement Driver |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Framework post** | "Here's how I think about X" | Saves and shares |
| **Contrarian take** | "Everyone says X. I disagree." | Comments and debate |
| **Case study** | "We tried X. Here's what happened." | Trust-building |
| **Lessons learned** | "5 things I learned building [product]" | Relatability |
| **Industry insight** | Data + non-obvious interpretation | Authority |

### Repurposing CT Content for LinkedIn

CT → LinkedIn requires:
1. **Tone shift:** More professional, less meme-y. Remove crypto slang.
2. **Format shift:** LinkedIn rewards longer posts. Expand a CT thread into a LinkedIn essay.
3. **Audience shift:** LinkedIn audience cares about business outcomes, not token prices.
4. **CTA shift:** LinkedIn CTAs are softer — "Thoughts?" or "Follow for more" rather than "Buy now"

### LinkedIn Algorithm Mechanics (2024-2025)

- **First 60 minutes matter most:** Engagement in the first hour determines reach
- **Comments > Likes:** Prioritize posts that generate discussion
- **Native content wins:** LinkedIn suppresses external links. Put the link in comments.
- **Consistency beats virality:** Posting 3x/week for 3 months > one viral post
- **Engage before posting:** Comment on 5 posts before publishing your own (warms the algorithm)

## Framework 6: Funnel Metrics Framework

### The Full Funnel

```
Awareness → Acquisition → Activation → Revenue → Retention → Referral
```

### Metrics by Stage

**Awareness:**
- Impressions (total reach)
- Share of voice (% of conversation in our category that mentions us)
- Brand search volume (Google Trends)

**Acquisition:**
- CTR (click-through rate from content to landing page)
- CPC (cost per click, if running paid)
- CAC (cost to acquire a customer, by channel)
- Signup rate (visitors → signups)

**Activation:**
- Time to first value (how long until a new user does the core action?)
- Activation rate (% of signups who complete the core action within 7 days)
- Onboarding completion rate

**Revenue:**
- MRR / ARR
- ARPU (average revenue per user)
- LTV (lifetime value)
- Payback period (CAC ÷ monthly gross margin per customer)

**Retention:**
- D7, D30 retention (% of users still active after 7/30 days)
- Churn rate (monthly)
- NPS (net promoter score)

**Referral:**
- Viral coefficient (K-factor): average new users each existing user brings in
- Referral rate: % of new signups from referrals

### What "Good" Looks Like (Crypto/SaaS Benchmarks)

| Metric | Good | Great |
|--------|------|-------|
| Signup rate (landing page) | 3-5% | 8%+ |
| Activation rate (7-day) | 20-30% | 40%+ |
| D30 retention | 20-30% | 40%+ |
| Monthly churn | < 5% | < 2% |
| K-factor | > 0.5 | > 1.0 (viral) |
| CAC payback | < 12 months | < 6 months |

```

## Framework 8: Viral Loop Design

### The 4 Types of Viral Loops

| Type | Mechanism | Example | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Word-of-mouth** | Users tell friends organically | Slack, Notion | Products with strong "aha moment" |
| **Incentivized** | Users get reward for referring | Dropbox, Uber | Products where users have clear network |
| **Product-led** | Product only works better with more users | Figma, Loom | Collaborative products |
| **Content** | Users create content that markets the product | TikTok, Canva | Products with shareable outputs |

### Viral Coefficient (K-Factor)

K = (invitations sent per user) × (conversion rate of invitations)

- K > 1: Viral growth (each user brings in more than 1 new user)
- K = 0.5-1: Strong word-of-mouth, not fully viral
- K < 0.5: Organic growth only, need paid or content to supplement

For Corners.market: K-factor opportunity = "Share this curation" feature that lets users share their watchlist publicly.

### Referral Program Design Principles

1. **Reward both sides** (referrer AND referee) — one-sided incentives underperform
2. **Make the reward relevant** — cash works, but product credits work better for retention
3. **Make sharing frictionless** — one-click share, pre-written copy, unique link
4. **Time the ask right** — ask for referrals at the moment of highest satisfaction (right after the "aha moment")
5. **Track everything** — unique links per user, attribution window, conversion rate

---

## Framework 9: Crypto Launch Playbook

Launching in crypto is different from SaaS. Community comes first.

### Pre-Launch: Community Seeding (T-30 to T-7)

1. **Build in public:** Share progress updates, behind-the-scenes, early screenshots
2. **Engage in relevant communities:** Be present in Base Discord, relevant Twitter spaces, Farcaster channels — before you need anything from them
3. **Identify early adopters:** Find the 50-100 people who would be perfect first users. Reach out personally.
4. **Seed the narrative:** Start talking about the problem you're solving, not the product. Build the "why this matters" before the "here's what we built."

### Launch Day: Sequenced Activation

```
12:01am PST: Product Hunt submission goes live
9am IST: Founder launch thread on Twitter
10am IST: LinkedIn announcement
11am IST: Community post in Base Discord / Farcaster
12pm IST: First wave of creator posts (5-10 creators)
3pm IST: Second wave of creator posts (10-15 creators)
6pm IST: Amplify best-performing posts, engage with all replies
9pm IST: "Day 1 update" post with early metrics
```

### Crypto-Specific Launch Channels

| Channel | What It's For | How to Use |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Twitter/X** | Primary launch channel | Thread + creator amplification |
| **Farcaster** | Crypto-native audience | Post natively, not just cross-post |
| **Base Discord** | Base ecosystem community | Announce in #projects or #showcase |
| **Product Hunt** | Broader tech audience | Launch at 12:01am PST for full day |
| **DeFi newsletters** | Targeted crypto audience | Reach out 2 weeks before launch |
| **Crypto Twitter KOLs** | Amplification | Brief 3-5 KOLs with early access |

### The Narrative Fit Test

Before launching, ask: "Does this fit the current crypto meta?"

Current meta signals (check CT for what's trending):
- Is Base ecosystem growth a narrative right now? → Corners.market fits
- Is developer tooling a narrative? → Early.build fits
- Is creator economy a narrative? → Both fit

If the narrative fit is weak, either wait for the right moment or reframe the launch to attach to a current narrative.

---

## Framework 10: Competitive Messaging Matrix

### The "Us vs Them" Decision

Use direct competitor comparisons when:
- You have a clear, defensible advantage on a dimension customers care about
- The competitor is well-known enough that the comparison provides context
- You can be specific (not just "we're better")

Avoid direct comparisons when:
- You're smaller and the comparison gives the competitor free attention
- The advantage is marginal or subjective
- It makes you look defensive

### Differentiation Messaging by Audience Segment

For Corners.market:

| Segment | Their Pain | Our Message |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Active Base traders | "I miss good projects because there's too much noise" | "Curated by builders who live on Base" |
| Crypto newcomers | "I don't know what's legit vs what's a rug" | "Human-vetted projects you can trust" |
| Project founders | "My project isn't getting discovered" | "Get in front of the right audience" |

For Early.build:

| Segment | Their Pain | Our Message |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Solo developers | "I waste hours evaluating tools that turn out to be abandoned" | "Only maintained, trusted tools make the cut" |
| Dev team leads | "My team uses inconsistent tools" | "The standard toolkit for modern dev teams" |
| Developers new to a stack | "I don't know which tools the community actually uses" | "What experienced developers actually use" |

### Handling "Why Not Just Use [Competitor]?"

Template response:
"[Competitor] is great for [what they do well]. The difference is [specific differentiator that matters to this person]. If [their specific pain] is your main concern, [our product] handles that better because [specific reason]."

Never trash competitors. Acknowledge what they do well. Then explain why you're different for this specific use case.
