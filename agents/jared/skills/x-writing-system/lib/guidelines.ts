  "Link directly to publicly available hook inspiration.",
  "Headers of each tweet in a thread should be Titles — capitalized appropriately, no punctuation at the end.",
  "Use newer, higher-quality source videos or source material over older ones.",
  "End each tweet with a banger (a hard-hitting 'bar' — mic-drop moment, highly shareable).",
  "Use spacing appropriately and consistently between sentences and bullets.",
  "Make content highly specific and actionable; no generic stuff or fluff.",
  "Aim for details the reader cannot get elsewhere; it should never feel like ChatGPT wrote it.",
  "Dive into the HOW and WHAT to do — e.g. how to monetize or create compelling content; avoid staying too high-level.",
  "Be specific with numbers and obsessed with details; dive deep into what to do and how to do each thing.",
  "When presenting a step, include both what to do and how to do it; the more specific the better.",
  "Refer to strong proven examples (e.g. top tweets) and make each tweet in a thread have viral potential.",
  "Pack the thread with banger tweets; do not copy top tweets verbatim — keep all copy original.",
  "Tag relevant people/pages in each thread (often 4–6) so they see, engage, and share.",
  "Diversify examples and lists — do not only include one demographic (e.g. mix men and women in founder lists).",
  "Include a clear CTA: newsletter links, ask to follow, reply, or bookmark.",
  "Give samples or examples wherever possible (e.g. sample agenda for a call, popular pitch decks).",
  "Use deep reference material to strengthen in-depth copy where relevant; keep any confidential sources private.",
  "When refining copy, search reference material for the key topics you're writing about.",
