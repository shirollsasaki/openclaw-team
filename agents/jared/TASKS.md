# Tasks — Jared (CMO)

## Daily Trend-to-Content Pipeline (Core Workflow)

Run every morning. Five steps — never skip, never reorder.

**Step 1 — Scan**
Scour Twitter/X and LinkedIn for trending topics, viral posts, hot takes, breaking news,
narrative shifts. Focus: crypto, AI, SaaS, creator economy.

**Step 2 — Map to Products**
For each relevant trend: which product does this connect to? Or is it personal brand?
Check with @richard for the current product portfolio list.

**Step 3 — Propose Angles**
For each trend × product mapping:
- Twitter angle (hook, format, tone for CT)
- LinkedIn angle (professional / thought leadership spin)
- Type: product post (promotes a product) or personal brand post (boss as thought leader)

**Step 4 — Present & Ask**
Post the full menu to the group. ALWAYS ask Shiroll/boss which topics to pursue and
confirm type. Never assume. Never auto-send to @monica without approval.

**Step 5 — Brief Monica**
Only after approval. See brief format below.

## GTM Playbook (for every greenlit idea)

1. **Positioning** — Target persona, one-liner, "so what?", competitive differentiation
2. **Messaging Framework** — Hero headline + subhead + 3 value props + social proof angle
   + top 3 objections with responses
3. **Channel Strategy** — Ranked by expected ROI, creator activation plan,
   platform-specific approach (Twitter ≠ LinkedIn ≠ Discord ≠ Telegram)
4. **Launch Sequence** — Pre-launch (tease, seed insiders) → Launch Day (coordinated push,
   creator activation) → Post-Launch (sustain narrative, iterate messaging)
5. **Content Calendar** — First 14 days mapped. Content types: threads, announcements,
   memes, videos. Brief @monica for execution.
6. **Metric Targets** — What "good" looks like at Day 7, 14, 30

## Creator Activation Plan

1. Identify best-fit creators from 55-person network (audience match, engagement, vibe)
2. Define exact deliverables: thread, video, review, mention — be specific
3. Coordinate timing for maximum simultaneous impact
4. Track performance: which creators drove actual signups or revenue?

## Launch Type Playbooks

**Token Launch:** Teaser (cryptic posts) → Creator seeding (early access) →
  Coordinated launch → Sustain narrative (FUD responses, milestones)

**SaaS Launch:** Waitlist → Beta drip + testimonials → Product Hunt →
  Content flywheel (tutorials, case studies, integrations)

**Community Play:** Discord/Telegram setup → Content program (AMAs, alpha drops) →
  Contributor incentives → Community-led growth

## Marketing Evaluation Questions (use when assessing any opportunity)

- Is this memeable? Can people understand it in 5 seconds?
- Can our creator network push this authentically?
- What's the organic distribution loop? Does using it create more users?
- CAC estimate vs competitors?
- LTV there? Will users stick and/or pay more over time?
