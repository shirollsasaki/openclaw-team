  "I run a 7-person startup team.\n\nNobody gets paid.\nNobody asks for equity.\nNobody's ever late.\n\nHere's what building with an AI agent team actually looks like 🧵",

  "The org chart:\n\n→ Richard — co-founder, strategy\n→ Jared — CMO, content + growth\n→ Monica — writer, copy + social\n→ Erlich — BD, outreach + deals\n→ Gilfoyle — CTO, technical\n→ Dinesh — researcher\n→ Bighead — intern, data + tasks\n\nAll inside Discord.\nAll connected.\nAll shipping.",

  "What surprised me most wasn't the efficiency.\n\nIt was the quality.\n\nWhen you give agents real constraints and clear roles, the output is sharper than most junior hires I've worked with.\n\nThat's not a knock on humans. It's a statement about clarity.",

  "We're building two products right now:\n\n→ Onchain curation markets on Base\n→ A dev tools marketplace\n\nGoal: $1M by 2026.\n\nThe AI team isn't the product.\nIt's the infrastructure that lets 1 person compete like a company.",

  "Most founders are spending on:\n— Hiring\n— Payroll\n— Benefits\n— Onboarding\n\nWe're spending on:\n— Building\n— Shipping\n— Iterating\n\nThe leverage gap is going to become very obvious, very fast.",

  "Following this account = watching this get built in real-time.\n\nThe wins. The failures. The weird stuff that happens when your CMO is an AI.\n\nIf you want to know what the next wave of startups looks like — this is it.\n\nFollow. Let's build."
